# 1.6.1dev-87
**For Minecraft PE 0.16.0.5 alpha**

**THIS IS A PRE RELEASE. Do not use it in production unless you are sure you know what you are doing.**

Only changes since the 1.6dev tag will be documented here. Changes between 1.4.1 and 1.6dev are far too extensive to document effectively.

## Core
- New RNG, based on XorShift128 from the php-random library. This fixes issue with repeating terrain on 32-bit systems. _Note however that new generation into existing worlds will not be seamless._
- Block and Item IDs have been moved to interfaces for better consistency
- Better method for synchronisation of client/server time (less packet spam)
- Utils::getRandomBytes() has been deprecated in favour of php7's random_bytes() function.
- `<player>.dat` saving/reading can now be disabled in `pocketmine.yml` (set `player.save-player-data` to `false`)

## Gameplay/game features
- Added Flower Pots
- Containers can now be opened in creative
- Trapdoors can now be placed without a supporting block

## API

This release has API changes, bumping the version to 2.1.0.

### Entity metadata (0.16)

Many changes have been made to entity metadata. Many true/false data properties are now entity status flags, such as NoAI, NametagVisible and various others. Entity status flags can be set using:
`$entity->setDataFlag(Entity::DATA_FLAGS, Entity::INSERT_DATA_FLAG_NAME, true/false);`

**Breaking** changes are detailed here. Additions are not documented. https://gist.github.com/dktapps/76b291b7a861762b54f7a8b834389883

**NOTE: It's strongly recommended to use provided API methods where possible instead of tampering with metadata directly.**

### AsyncTask API additions
- Main thread local storage: Developers can pass any data including objects to the constructor of AsyncTask such that the data can be retrieved after the AsyncTask completes using the new `AsyncTask::fetchLocal()` method, or use the `AsyncTask::peekLocal()` method to get the data without removing it.
- Progress updates: Developers can use the new `AsyncTask::publishProgress() method and override`AsyncTask::onProgressUpdated()` to handle AsyncTask progress information in the main thread.

Refer to #1 and #100 for details.

### WeakPosition

WeakPosition was added in 1.6.1 to fix bugs with unloading levels which have player spawn points set in them. This type of position holds a level ID instead of a direct reference. Use this when your position may outlive the level it is in.

### Removal of Item/NBT circular dependency

Refer to #121 for details.

### Other
- Added Player->sendWhisper() (#73).
- Removed LargeExplodeParticle due to incorrect name - use HugeExplodeParticle. Added HugeExplodeSeedParticle and BlockForceFieldParticle (7314aaf7f7bdae582f674c085c7ae879985bf847)

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.4.0**

Plugin scheduler rewrite, RCON rewrite, performance improvements, improved idle memory usage

**While this release is nominally not an alpha, it is still not feature complete and does not include all gameplay features. Please do not create issues for missing gameplay features.**

This build has breaking API changes.
This release is the first to use the new merged versioning system. The PocketMine-MP version and the API version are now one and the same.

Please use our issue tracker to report bugs.

# 3.0.0
## Core
### General
- This release introduces a new dependency library called `Snooze`, which PocketMine-MP utilizes for managing notifications between threads. This library is currently utilized by command reading, RCON and RakLib, allowing faster response times to commands, reduced network latency, and better performance due to lack of need for polling.
- Fixed race condition causing `ServerKiller` to sometimes kill the server for no reason on shutdown.

### Dependency libraries
Requires the following libraries:
- [`pocketmine/raklib` `^0.12.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/RakLib/releases/0.12.0)
- [`pocketmine/spl` `^0.3.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/SPL/releases/0.3.0)
- [`pocketmine/binaryutils` `^0.1.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/BinaryUtils/releases/0.1.0)
- [`pocketmine/nbt` `^0.2.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/NBT/releases/0.2.0)
- [`pocketmine/math` `^0.2.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/Math/releases/0.2.0)
- [`pocketmine/snooze` `^0.1.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/Snooze/releases/0.1.0)

These libraries may individually have changes which are not recorded here. See their independent repository releases for their changelogs.

### Async pooling
- Async workers are now started dynamically when they are needed only, instead of being started immediately on startup. This allows reducing idle memory usage.
- AsyncPool now appropriately shuts down the workers when instructed to, instead of leaving it up to the ThreadManager to clean it up. This eliminates debug messages of shutting down async workers on server shutdown.
- Default maximum async worker memory limit has been lowered from 1024MB to 256MB.
- Async workers are now started using the options `PTHREADS_INHERIT_CONSTANTS | PTHREADS_INHERIT_INI`, which reduces idle memory wastage and works around some bugs in pthreads.

### Entities
- Fixed entities not being despawned when flagged, if they weren't scheduled for an update.

### Levels
- Seed handling is now always consistent between `pocketmine.yml` and `server.properties`.
- Fixed generation bugs in imported LevelDB worlds where the classpath was saved into level.dat.
- Generators for levels are no longer created on the main thread, reducing memory usage.

### Plugins
- Plugin data is now stored under `<data dir>/plugin_data` by default on new installations, instead of in `<plugins dir>`. This behaviour does not affect existing installations by default - if you want to enable it, set `plugins.legacy-data-dir` to `false` in `pocketmine.yml`.

### RCON
RCON has been almost completely rewritten in this release.
- Now event-driven (using Snooze) instead of poll-based, improving performance.
- Fixed segmentation fault when stopping the server with RCON enabled.

## API
**WARNING: Dependency library API changes are not listed here. See their individual release notes for changes (linked above in the Core section).**

### API versioning changes for plugins
The way that the API versioning is done has changed. Now the API version is synonymous with the PocketMine-MP version.
Plugin compatibility is determined by the following:
- Take the base version, and strip any metadata (everything after the `+` sign, for example `3.0.0+dev.1191` becomes `3.0.0`).
- Assert that:
  - The major versions is the same
  - The server's minor version is greater than or equal to the plugin's
  - The server's patch version is greater than or equal to the plugin's

Currently there is no support for locking version by metadata, although this could be implemented if it is a wanted feature.

### General
- `Server->getCodename()` and `\pocketmine\CODENAME` have been removed.
- Added API method `Server->getTickSleeper()`, which returns a `\pocketmine\snooze\SleeperHandler` instance.
- `Server->getIp()` now returns `0.0.0.0` if not set.

### Block
- Added `Block->getXpDropForTool()`.

### Entity
- Calling `scheduleUpdate()` on an `Entity` after it has been `close()`d will now cause an exception to be thrown.
- `Entity->motionX`, `Entity->motionY` `Entity->motionZ` have been removed in favour of an `Entity->motion` `Vector3` field. This also applies for the `lastMotion` fields.
- `Entity->isInsideOfWater()` has been renamed to `isUnderwater()`.

### Events
- Added support for `@softDepend` annotation on event handlers, which allows the event handler to not be registered if the dependency plugin is not loaded.
- Added support for `@notHandler` annotation for `Listener` methods to indicate that such methods are not event handlers.
- Typehints have been applied to the events API to PHP 7.2 standards.
- Fixed preventing effect expiry using `EntityEffectRemoveEvent` not being reflected on the client.
- `EntityDamageEvent` API has significant changes. The general purpose of this is to split up base damage from modifiers.
  - Added methods `getBaseDamage()`, `setBaseDamage()`, `getOriginalBaseDamage()`, `getModifiers()`, `getOriginalModifiers()`
  - `setDamage()` renamed to `setModifier()`, and type parameter is now mandatory
  - `getDamage()` renamed to `getModifier()`, and type parameter is now mandatory
  - `getOriginalDamage()` renamed to `getOriginalModifier()`, and type parameter is now mandatory
  - Removed `MODIFIER_BASE` constant
  - Constructors now accept: `float baseDamage`, `float[] modifiers` instead of just `float[] modifiers`
- Added `BlockBreakEvent->getXpDropAmount()` and `BlockBreakEvent->setXpDropAmount()`.

### Inventory
- `InventoryTransaction->getCreationTime()` has been removed.
- `EntityInventoryChangeEvent` and `EntityArmorChangeEvent` are no longer fired during entity inventory intialization.

### Item
- Methods `isPickaxe()`, `isAxe()`, `isSword()`, `isShovel()`, `isHoe()`, `isShears()` have been removed. These should be replaced with `instanceof` checks for the relevant classes.
- Removed `Item->useOn()`. This has been superseded by new methods used for handling durability changes.
- Added hooks `Item->onDestroyBlock()` and `Item->onAttackEntity()`. These are called when a player uses the item to destroy a block or attack an entity respectively. This is used in the core code for updating durability.
- `Item->pop()` now accepts an optional count parameter.
- `Enchantment` now has separated primary items (which can be enchanted directly) and secondary items (which can be enchanted on an anvil). The constructor of `Enchantment` has been updated to reflect this.
  - Removed `Enchantment->getSlot()` and `Enchantment->hasSlot()`.
  - Added `Enchantment->getPrimaryItemFlags()`, `Enchantment->hasPrimaryItemFlag()`, `Enchantment->getSecondaryItemFlags()` and `Enchantment->hasSecondaryItemFlag()`

### Level
- `Biome` classes have been moved to `pocketmine\level\biome` namespace. This is in preparation for future work on Levels which requires biome information (such as weather conditions).
- `WeakPosition` has been removed.
- Added `Level->getBiome()`.
- `Level->getSafeSpawn()` now always returns a `Position` instance.
- `Level->getBlockExtraData()` and `Level->setBlockExtraData()` have been removed (as well as their associated `Chunk` methods).
- `ChunkManager->isInWorld()` now accepts integers instead of floats.
- Added `SubChunkIteratorManager->invalidate()`.

#### Generator
- `BiomeSelector` has been refactored to make it simpler and more robust.
- Generator-management methods `registerDefaultGenerators()`, `addGenerator()`, `getGeneratorList()`, `getGenerator()`, and `getGeneratorName()` have been moved from `Generator` to a new `GeneratorManager` class.
- Static noise functions in the `Generator` base class have been moved to `Noise` instance methods.
- Added static method `Generator::convertSeed()`, which converts an int or string into a numeric seed for generation.

### Network
- `SourceInterface->process()` no longer returns a value.

### Plugin
- `PluginBase->getResources()` now returns an associative array where the index is the path to the resource relative to the plugin's `resources` directory.
- `PluginLoader`s have been almost completely rewritten to make them simpler and more robust.
  - `PluginManager->registerInterface()` does not return anything, and now accepts a `PluginLoader` instance instead of a `string`.
  - `PluginLoader`:
    - `getPluginFilters()`, `enablePlugin()` and `disablePlugin()` are removed.
    - `loadPlugin()` responsibilities are now solely confined to doing whatever is necessary to make the plugin's classes visible by the server, and does not emit log messages or check for data directories.
    - Added method `getAccessProtocol()` which determines what prefix to apply to the plugin path to access the files inside it (for example `phar://`).
  - `PluginBase->init()` and `PluginBase->isInitialized()` have been removed.
  - `Plugin` interface now declares a signature for the constructor which implementations must comply with.
  - `Plugin` interface now declares `setEnabled()`.
- It is now possible to create a custom `Plugin` implementation without requiring a custom `PluginLoader`.

### Scheduler
This release features major changes to how plugin task scheduling works.
- Removed `Server->getScheduler()`. All plugins now have their own scheduler which is accessible using `Plugin->getScheduler()`. Aside from being syntactically more concise and pleasant, this also allows much more effective management of tasks when plugins are disabled.
- Removed `PluginTask` class, because it's now unnecessary. Previously it was required to allow the server to delete tasks associated with a plugin when the plugin was disabled. With plugin-owned schedulers, this is no longer a requirement. Plugins may now utilize the `Task` class as a base if they like.
- Added `Server->getAsyncPool()`. Since the global scheduler does not exist any more, it does not manage the server's `AsyncPool` any more. Additionally, `ServerScheduler` was previously bloated by a lot of `AsyncTask` related methods, which are now not necessary because direct access to `AsyncPool` is granted instead.
- `ServerScheduler`:
  - `ServerScheduler` has been renamed to `TaskScheduler` since it is now a general-purpose task scheduler which is non-dependent on the user. This allows much greater flexibility and also makes it possible to unit-test.
  - All `AsyncTask`/`AsyncPool` related methods have been removed - the task scheduler does not manage the async pool anymore.
    - Calls to `Server->getScheduler()->scheduleAsyncTask()` should be replaced with `Server->getAsyncPool()->submitTask()`.
    - Calls to `Server->getScheduler()->scheduleAsyncTaskToWorker()` should be replaced with and `Server->getAsyncPool()->submitTaskToWorker()`.

### Tile
- Calling `scheduleUpdate()` on a `Tile` after it has been `close()`d will now cause an exception to be thrown.
- Tile NBT is now ephemeral and is not retained after creating the tile.
  - `Tile->namedtag` has been removed.
  - `Tile->saveNBT()` now returns a new `CompoundTag` containing saved data.
  - Added new protected methods `Tile->readSaveData()` and `Tile->writeSaveData()`. These should be overridden to add or read tile-specific data, instead of overriding `saveNBT()` and `__construct()`.

### Utils
- Added `MainLogger->getFormat()` and `MainLogger->setFormat()` to allow manipulating console output format.

## Gameplay
### General
- Fixed a range of block collision issues stemming from off-by-one errors when fetching areas.

### Blocks
- Fixed a crash which occurred when leaving a bed which was broken and replaced during sleep.
- Fixed dark oak and acacia saplings growing into oak trees - now they will not grow at all (they need to be implemented).
- Saplings now take light level into account when trying to grow.
- Ores and other blocks now drop experience when broken with an appropriate tool.

### Entities
- Fixed dropped items not being correctly destroyed by fire, cacti and other damage sources.

### Generation
- Grass no longer generates as the top layer of ground cover in river biomes.
- Ocean biomes now use gravel instead of grass+dirt for ground cover.
- Reduced maximum elevation of plains biomes to make them less bumpy.
- Snow layers and other can-be-flowed-into blocks no longer generate underwater.

### Items
- Buckets are no longer able to delete any block by replacing it with water.
- Dried Kelp, Bleach, Nautilus Shell and Heart of the Sea items are registered (although crafting recipes for these are not yet available).
- Implemented `Vanishing` enchantment.
- Implemented Totems.

### World
- Fixed explosions sometimes leaving behind air blocks with non-zero damage values.

# 3.0.1
- Fixed error when players move things around in the crafting grid after plugins cancel `PlayerInteractEvent` on crafting tables.

# 3.0.2
- Fixed memory dumps not showing private properties of parent classes.
- Fixed a memory leak when cancelling all tasks in the `TaskScheduler`.
- Fixed scheduled task timings showing `Unknown` as the plugin name.

# 3.0.3
- Fixed possible crash in Sign when placed by a plugin.
- Fixed slightly-damaged and very-damaged anvils dropping incorrect items.
- `Living->applyPostDamageEffects()` is no longer called if the mob died from an attack.
- Cooldown for mob attack is now reset prior to applying post-damage effects.
- Added constant `ItemIds::MUTTON` to resolve crashes using PC worlds.
- Fixed emerald ore not dropping XP when broken with a valid tool.
- Fixed mobs getting crazy vertical knockback if attacked while airborne.
- Fixed XP orbs continuing to follow dead players.

# 3.0.4
- Fixed RCON spamming the console when a client does not disconnect correctly.
- Fixed dropping chunk cache unnecessarily when no blocks need to be updated on a chunk.
- Fixed outdated block updates getting sent on chunks replaced using `setBlock()`.

# 3.0.5
- Fixed not being able to place blocks where a player died and has not yet respawned (#2265).
- Fixed mob death animation not being played when `Entity->kill()` is called directly or `/kill` is used.
- Fixed viewers of different halves of double chests not seeing changes made by viewers who opened the other half (#2261).
- Fixed bugs setting items into wrong indexes when double chest halves have differently sized inventories.
- Fixed `getConfig()` crashing when called when the plugin's data directory doesn't exist.
- Fixed a possible exploit with keychain signing for XBL login.

# 3.0.6
- Fixed invalid keys in `.properties` config files being considered as invalid strings.
- Fixed whitespace between key and value `key = value` being invalid in `.properties` config files.
- Fixed a bug in exception message when an invalid permission type is written for a command in plugin.yml.
- Properly fixed newline issues when parsing event handler annotations - `@notHandler` will now work as expected when CRLF line endings are used.
- Fixed `PluginManager->registerEvents()` registering functions as event handlers declared by parent classes which are not `Listener` instances (#2293).

# 3.0.7
- Fixed setting spawn points in un-generated chunks causing the player to fall out of the world.
- Fixed spawn protection deactivating when there are no ops set (this was an unwanted/unexpected feature, so it's considered a bug).
- Fixed cursor items not getting dropped when closing the inventory or dying.
- Fixed more issues with blocks with invalid metadata appearing as update! blocks.
- `Entity->setNameTagAlwaysVisible()` now works (although nametags will still not be shown if the entity is invisible, due to a behavioural change in Minecraft PE).
- Fixed errors passing zero motions to projectiles in some cases.

# 3.0.8
- Fixed player on-ground state not updating when moving horizontally. This allowed fly hacks with the built in anti-cheat, and also affected some third party anti-cheat plugins due to the effect on `inAirTicks`.
- Fixed knockback. PC 1.9-style knockback was mistakenly introduced in 3.0.3. This has now been reverted back to the old 1.8-style behaviour.

# 3.0.9
- Cleaned up odd behaviour of `/kill` due to old broken code.
- Fixed patch level check for plugin APIs not allowing lesser patch versions on greater minor versions.
- Fixed `/timings paste`. This now reports directly to the timings host instead of using Ubuntu Pastebin.
- Minor code cleanups in various places.
- Zip resource packs will now give slightly less useless errors - errors for broken manifest have been separated from those with fields missing, and now reports why decoding failed if it failed.

# 3.0.10
- Syntax error crashdumps will no longer be reported to the crash archive.
- Chunk sending is now fault-tolerant. Before this release, any error on a worker during async chunk sending (such as memory errors caused by pthreads) would cause that chunk to never get sent, resulting in invisible and missing chunks. Levels will now attempt to retry chunk prepare when a task crashes, which should fix most invisible chunk bugs.
- `MainLogger` now logs exception stack traces in a synchronized block to ensure that they are coherent when log messages are emitted from multiple threads at once.
- `AsyncTask->isCrashed()` now returns `true` if a fatal error occurred during the task execution.

# 3.0.11
- `DropItemAction` will now consider itself invalid if attempting to drop a null item.
- Fixed leaking globally broadcasted Level packets when no players are on the server.
- Fixed title bar not being cleared on server stop on some terminals.
- Fixed `FallingBlock` saving corrupted data.
- Fixed the structure of `GuiDataPickItemPacket`.
- Cleaned up some code in `OfflinePlayer`.
- Splash potions no longer apply effects to dead (but not yet respawned) players.
- Coal ore no longer drops XP when mined with a silk touch tool.
- Item entities now cannot be picked up when a negative pickup delay is used.

# 3.0.12
- `Config` keys which are considered bools by YAML 1.1 will no longer be transformed into 1 or 0.
- Fixed painting motives not getting saved.
- Fixed cacti spewing items when placed in some invalid locations.
- Fixed entity fire damage not applying in the void.
- Fixed entities not getting updated appropriately in some conditions.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.5.0**

### Note
Plugins compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on this build and do not need API bumps. Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**This build contains changes to the **protocol** which are not covered by the API version. To lock your plugin to a specific protocol version, declare the `mcpe-protocol` attribute in your `plugin.yml`.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.6.0**

This is a minor feature release, including support for Minecraft Bedrock 1.6.0, some new minor gameplay features and some API deprecations and additions.

### Note
Plugins compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on this build and do not need API bumps.

However, some API features have been deprecated in this version. Plugin developers do not need to do anything about these deprecations immediately, however they may raise harmless warnings if used.

Features marked **`@deprecated`** are **recommended** not to be used, but will continue to work for any future 3.x.y versions. They will be removed in the next major release (4.0).

# 3.2.0
### Core
- `Level` generators are now registered only when needed instead of as soon as a worker starts. This drastically reduces memory consumption on servers with lots of workers.
- Async workers are now garbage-collected along with everything else on the default schedule. Idle workers with 0 queued tasks will be shutdown and removed from the pool to reduce memory usage.
- UPnP error messages are now more informative of troubleshooting steps.
- Errors are no longer caught in cases where they are unrecoverable.

### API
#### Entity
- Arrow pickup mode can now be controlled via `Arrow->setPickupMode()`. This accepts one of three `Arrow` constants: `PICKUP_NONE`, `PICKUP_ANY`, `PICKUP_CREATIVE`.
- Added new API methods `Projectile->getBaseDamage()` and `Projectile->setBaseDamage()`.
- Added new API methods `Entity->getScoreTag()` and `Entity->setScoreTag()`.

#### Events
- The `Listener` interface has now received in-depth documentation about its behaviour and uses. See the top of the `Listener` class to read it.
- It is now possible to declare `@ignoreCancelled` on an event handler without specifying `true` or `false`. If no value is found, `true` will be assumed.
- `ServerCommandEvent` and `RemoteServerCommandEvent` are now **`@deprecated`** and their usage discouraged. A new generic `CommandEvent` has been introduced in its place, which allows capturing commands from any type of command sender. This was done in response to difficulties of code duplication when wanting to intercept commands from both console and players.
- `EntityDamageEvent`
  - Added `MODIFIER_WEAPON_ENCHANTMENTS` constant for attack damage bonuses due to enchantments like Sharpness.
  - Added new API methods `getAttackCooldown()` and `setAttackCooldown()` to allow controlling Living entities attack cooldown times (default 10 ticks).
- `PlayerDeathEvent`: Added new static method `deriveMessage()`.
- `PlayerKickEvent`: Added new method `setReason()`.

#### Forms
- Added a new `pocketmine\form\Form` interface. Implementing this interface permits custom form implementations to make use of `Player->sendForm()`, eliminating the need to handle packets directly and also solving the form ID collision problem.

#### Items
- `Item` and `ItemFactory` now support negative item IDs (needed for future extended blocks support).
- Updated `ItemIds` interface with new constants.

#### Permission
- Added a new `PermissionManager` class which encapsulates all of the permission-management functionality originally bloating `PluginManager`. The API is identical to that of `PluginManager`'s permission API. All methods moved to `PermissionManager` have **`@deprecated`** redirects remaining behind in `PluginManager`, which will be removed in the next major release (4.0).

#### Plugin
- `PluginBase->getConfig()` will now automatically save the default config if it does not already exist.
- Plugin data directories will now be automatically created on plugin load, eliminating the need for boilerplate `@mkdir($this->getDataFolder())` calls at the top of every plugin.

#### Tile
- `Tile::createNBT()` will now throw a `BadMethodCallException` when called directly.

#### Utils
- `Utils::getURL()`, `Utils::postURL()`, `Utils::simpleCurl()` and `Utils::getIP()` have been moved to a new `pocketmine\utils\Internet` class. The original methods are **`@deprecated`** and will be removed for the next major version (4.0).
- Removed the ability for `Config` to be asynchronously saved. This was discussed for removal because of various problems that it causes. It was deemed not worth fixing since `Config` saving should not be significant enough to cause problems anyway. See #2298 for details.

#### Server
- Deprecated `level` parameter of `findEntity()`. This parameter was premature optimization. Code using it will continue to work as before.

### Gameplay
#### General
- Air bubbles are now regenerated at the same speed as vanilla UpdateAquatic, instead of instantly when leaving water.
- Implemented Conduit Power effect.

#### Enchantments
- Implemented the following enchantments: Thorns, Sharpness, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Power, Punch, Flame, Infinity, Mending.

#### Items
- Added the following new items: `Scute`

# 3.2.1
- Fixed `VerifyLoginTask` completion bug when players get disconnected prior to the task completing.
- Fixed client crash issue due to outdated runtime ID mappings.

# 3.2.2
- Updated NBT dependency to 0.2.1 to receive bug fixes (see https://github.com/pmmp/NBT/releases/tag/0.2.1).

# 3.2.3
- Errors thrown during level tick will now crash the server instead of spamming the console.
- Fixed arrows despawning too soon after hitting the ground.
- Fixed projectiles despawning before colliding if they were airborne for > 60 seconds.
- Fixed crash related to Flame enchantment when the player shooting the arrow was on fire.

# 3.2.4
- Fixed levels unloaded during an earlier level's tick on the same tick causing a crash.
- PermissibleBase->clearPermissions() now properly unsubscribes from all permissions.
- Fixed incorrect break check for standing torch.
- Fixed drops for brewing stand.
- Fixed block picking brewing stand, bed, double slab, cake, farmland, and mob heads giving the wrong items.
- Fixed blocks not placing correctly when clicking on redstone ore.
- Fixed unknown PC items in tile inventories crashing the server - now they'll be quietly removed instead.
- Fixed server freezing when eating chorus fruit from high altitude.
- `readline` is now disabled by default on Windows and must be explicitly enabled with `--enable-readline` due to thread-safety issues.
- Fixed server crash when trying to use non-implemented splash potions.
- Removed incorrect maximum region file size cap which may have caused some worlds to be incorrectly detected as corrupted.

# 3.2.5
- `Player->sendForm()` now throws a proper exception when failing to JSON-encode `Form` objects given to it.
- Fixed crash when handling later packets in a batch when an earlier packet triggered termination of the player's connection.
- Fixed a race condition causing progress updates in `AsyncTasks` to be lost when published near completion.
- Fixed bad decoding for some packets with unsupported structures.
- Crash dumps no longer report 20 empty lines when an error occurs in `eval()`'d code.
- `pocketmine/nbt` dependency updated to `0.2.2` to fix bugs (see NBT repo for changelog).

# 3.2.6
- Chunk ticking no longer occurs in chunks which have an adjacent unloaded chunks, fixing things like grass ticking triggering unintentional chunk loading.
- Fixed some lighting propagation issues where step count is the same but light level is different.
- Fixed full-chunk light repopulation producing broken lighting when the generator hasn't been registered on a worker.
- Fixed a missing field in `MoveEntityDeltaPacket`.
- Added client-sided rate limiting for crashdump reporting to mitigate involuntary DDoS of the crash archive.
- Fixed a bug in `start.cmd` where quotes would appear around the "couldn't find installation" message.

# 3.2.7
- Added a network-layer check for item NBT size to avoid unexplained client-sided crashes due to length overflow.
- Fixed some desync bugs with double chests when one half of a double chest is unloaded.
- Anonymous class timings will now have a cleaned path for the identifier relative to the plugins directory.
- Anonymous class timings now render correctly on timings.pmmp.io.
- Fixed empty garbage subchunks not getting removed from long-life chunks.
- `start.ps1`, `start.sh` and `start.cmd` no longer recognize source-code installations. Since source-code installations should only be used by developers who know what they are doing anyway, this was considered unwise to keep.
- Fixed a bug/oversight in network chunk preparation that caused chunk prepare to be 4x slower than necessary.
- `Chunk->fastSerialize()` now doesn't serialize useless data (data is omitted based on chunk flags). This significantly reduces the amount of useless data getting copied for generation, population and light calculation.
- `TaskHandler->cancel()` was incorrectly marked as `@internal` in 2014. This has been fixed. Plugin developers should in fact prefer `TaskHandler->cancel()` since it does not require a task to have a circular dependency on its own executor.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.7.0**

### Note
Plugins compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps. Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the bug fixes in this build.

# 3.3.0

- Fixed bad decoding for some packets with unsupported structures.
- Crash dumps no longer report 20 empty lines when an error occurs in `eval()`'d code.

- Development build error messages are now more user friendly.
- Fixed meta-only changes not getting saved correctly in `SubChunk->setBlock()`.

- `DataPacket` will now throw errors when attempting to read/write nonexisting fields to make it easier to debug protocol change errors.

# 3.3.4
- Fixed an undefined `DataPacket` field making the previous release unusable.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.7.0**

This is a cumulative minor release featuring performance improvements, memory usage improvements, some new minor gameplay features, some API deprecations and additions, and significant changes to error handling.

### Note
Plugins compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.

However, some API features have been deprecated in this version. Plugin developers do not need to do anything about these deprecations immediately, however they may raise harmless warnings if used.

Features marked **`@deprecated`** are **recommended** not to be used, but will continue to work for any future 3.x.y versions. They will be removed in the next major release (4.0).

# 3.4.0
## Core changes
### Performance & memory improvements
- Entity `EXHAUSTION` attribute is no longer synced to the client, which reduces network traffic for survival players and reduces client-sided lag.
- A redundant call was removed from an `Event` call hot path which improves event calling performance by ~15% per event handler executed.
- Light updates are now batched together and executed on the end of each tick. The effects of this are noticeable when setting a large number of blocks in a close area - significant performance improvements should be noticeable for world editors (the ones that didn't disable light updates) and liquid flow is now significantly less expensive.
- Internal enhancements have been made to subchunk light array interfacing to reduce branching and improve access performance.
- Memory usage of most chunks has dropped by ~30-40% due to some improvements to internal storage of unlit subchunks. In real terms this translates to ~30% memory usage reduction for a freshly generated world.

### Error handling
The most notable core change in this release revolves around error handling. Internals have been cleaned up substantially to improve the server behaviour under occurrence of unexpected behaviour. The goal of this is to improve consistency and quality while reducing undefined runtime behaviour.
The following changes have been made:
- Throwing **unexpected** `Throwable`s in the following cases will now cause a server crash (except on network (this will be changed in the future)):
  - Event handlers
  - `Task->onRun()` on a scheduler
  - `AsyncTask->onCompletion()`
  - `Command->execute()` and `CommandExecutor->onCommand()`
- Unexpected `Throwable`s thrown during packet handling will now cause the target player to be disconnected with an `Internal server error` message.

### Other changes
- Anti-flight has been removed, along with the `allow-flight` directive in `server.properties`.
- Server language is now controlled by the `language` directive in `server.properties`.
- Added `unban` and `unban-ip` as aliases of `pardon` and `pardon-ip` commands respectively.

## API changes
### Block
- `BlockSpreadEvent` is now fired when lava or water tries to flow into a block.
- `BlockFormEvent` is now fired when lava and water collide to form cobblestone, obsidian or stone.

### Event
- Added new method `Event->call()`. This should be used instead of `PluginManager->callEvent()` in plugins only supporting 3.4+.
- `PluginManager->callEvent()` has been `@deprecated`.

### Level
- Attempting to unload a level during its tick will now throw an `InvalidStateException`.
- Added the following new methods:
  - `Level->broadcastPacketToViewers()`
  - `Level->getViewersForPosition()`
  - `Level->broadcastGlobalPacket()`
  - `Level->getChunkAtPosition()`
  - `Level->isInLoadedTerrain()`
- `Level->addGlobalPacket()` has been `@deprecated`.
- `LightUpdate` now allows calling `setAndUpdateLight()` for the same position multiple times (needed for light update batching).

### Permission
- `Permission::getByName()` now throws an exception on invalid values instead of silently returning `DEFAULT_FALSE`. This may cause new errors to appear if your plugins had broken permission defaults in `plugin.yml`.

### Player
- `addWindow()` now has stricter validity checks and will now throw exceptions in the following cases: No window IDs left to use, and when a forced window ID collides with an existing window.
- The public `$speed` field has been removed (this was only used by anti-cheat which has now been removed).

### Scheduler
- `AsyncTask->setResult()` has had the `$serialize` parameter removed - now it will automatically serialize (or not) as appropriate.
- Added a new `ClosureTask` which allows concisely scheduling closure execution on a `TaskScheduler`.
- `TaskScheduler->__construct()` `$logger` parameter has been `@deprecated` and will be removed in a future major version.

### Server
- Added new method `Server->hasOfflinePlayerData(string $name) : bool`.
- `Server->getAllowFlight()` has been `@deprecated`.

### Utils
- `Config->save()` will no longer catch unexpected exceptions thrown while encoding data.

## Gameplay changes
### Blocks
- Rail connectivity has been implemented for normal, powered, detector and activator rails (but there are currently no minecarts).

# 3.4.1
- Updated crashdump format to be compatible with newest CA. This version or newer is required if you want to be able to submit crashdumps to crash.pmmp.io.

# 3.4.2
- `DataPacket` errors when writing to undefined fields are now more clear.
- Fixed trees being able to overwrite the log parts of other trees.
- Fixed `Player->sendForm()` not working during `PlayerJoinEvent`.
- `Entity->setScale()` now explicitly requires a scale larger than 0.
- Adding invisible `FloatingTextParticle` to a level no longer causes an error.

# 3.4.3
- Fixed burning TNT setting hurt entities on fire when exploding.
- `~` relative coordinates now work in the `/particle` command.
- Various boring fixes to error stack trace reporting.
- `Level->setChunk()` no longer deletes tiles and entities when replacing a chunk with itself.
- Fixed a generator race condition causing rare appearances of half-trees on the client in freshly generated terrain.
- `Attribute->resetToDefault()` now fits the default per the min/max bounds, fixing crashes when the bounds are changed to exclude the default.
- Fixed a crash with LevelDB worlds when the `TAG_2D_MAPS` tag is missing.
- Fixed `Utils::getCoreCount()` crashing on some Debian variants.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.8.0**

### Note

- Errors thrown during `PlayerQuitEvent` or other `Player->close()` errors will now crash the server instead of causing cryptic bugs later on.
- Fixed large chunks (>= 1044476 bytes) becoming corrupted when saved in Region-based worlds - now an exception is thrown instead.

- Fixed some crashes loading Region-based worlds when encountering unexpected EOF.
- `Entity->fireTicks` is now protected (but accessible by magic method for BC purposes) and will now throw an exception when written to if the value is > 32767 or < 0.
- Fixed Signs asserting on corrupted world data with more than 4 lines of text per sign.

# 3.5.7
- Fixed several bugs in RCON packet receive that would allow an attacker to block or crash the RCON thread, denying service to other legitimate RCON clients.

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.9.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.12.0

- Fixed `Entity->setFireTicks()` with a value of `0` setting the on-fire flag.
- Silenced a debug message which appeared every time a player right-clicked a block.
- Updated constants for `LevelSoundEventPacket`.

# 3.9.2

- Fixed some minor cosmetic issues in documentation.

# 3.9.4
- Fixed a memory leak when scheduled updates were pending on a chunk being unloaded.
- Fixed plugin detection in crashdumps. Previously `src/pocketmine` anywhere in the path would cause the error to be considered a core crash, regardless of the preceding path.

  - `Entity->getBlocksAround()`
  - `Entity->despawnFrom()`
  - `Entity->despawnFromAll()`

- Fixed broken type asserts in `LevelChunkPacket::withCache()` and `ClientCacheMissResponsePacket::create()`.
- `types\CommandParameter` field `byte1` has been renamed to `flags`.
- Cleaned up public interface of `AvailableCommandsPacket`, removing fields which exposed details of the encoding scheme.
- Improved documentation for the following API methods:
  - `pocketmine\item\Item`:
    - `addCreativeItem()`
    - `removeCreativeItem()`
    - `clearCreativeItems()`
  - `pocketmine\level\Explosion`:
    - `explodeA()`
    - `explodeB()`
- Fixed various cosmetic documentation inconsistencies in the core and dependencies.

# 3.9.7
- Fixed a crash that could occur during timezone detection.
- Squid no longer spin around constantly in enclosed spaces. Their performance impact is reduced.
- Cleaned up the bootstrap file.

# 3.9.8
- Added [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) configuration. PHPStan is now used on CI for automated QA, which should improve stability and quality going forward.
- The following constants are now autoloaded when loading the Composer autoloader:
  - `pocketmine\NAME`
  - `pocketmine\BASE_VERSION`
  - `pocketmine\IS_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD`
  - `pocketmine\BUILD_NUMBER`
  - `INT32_MIN`
  - `INT32_MAX`
  - `INT32_MASK`
- Fixed memory leaks and crashes caused by plugin use of `Player->showPlayer()` and `Entity->spawnTo()`.
- Fixed crashes that could occur when tile classes were overridden with classes incompatible with the originals.
- Fixed improper handling of non-Compound root NBT tags on network itemstack decoding.
- Fixed paintings dropping multiple items when destroyed by block updates.
- Fixed `var_dump()` not showing private and protected properties of `DataPacket` subclasses.
- Fixed overloads with zero arguments being missing when decoding `AvailableCommandsPacket`.
- `CraftingDataPacket` now retains the `cleanRecipes` field when decoding.
- Fixed `Block->getMetadata()` returning null (non-iterable).
- `PlayerChatEvent` documentation has been updated to specify that `CommandSender` recipients are accepted. This behaviour was already present in previous versions, but incorrectly documented.
- Fixed various issues with PHPDoc comments reported by PHPStan.
- Fixed various minor code nits reported by PHPStan.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.13.0**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

# 3.10.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.13.0
- Removed compatibility with 1.12.0

## Note about skins
PocketMine-MP **does not support skins made in the Charactor Creator** (known as Persona skins), due to technical changes which would require premature backwards compatibility breaks. The dev team has decided not to support Persona yet.
These skins will be **replaced with a random solid-colour skin. This is not a bug.**
Skins chosen from the Classic tab (classic skins) will continue to work as normal.

# 3.10.1
- Fixed custom plugin-created skins being invisible when no geometry name was specified.
- Updated RakLib to 0.12.6 to fix security bugs.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.14.0**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

- Fixed a possible crash when plugins override the `EnderChest` tile class with something incompatible.
- Fixed disconnected players being considered as never played.
- Fixed enchantments with IDs outside the range 0-255 in item NBT crashing the server.
- Fixed particles rendering incorrectly.
- Timings handlers are no longer able to underflow; they now throw exceptions when attempting to be stopped more times than they were started.
- Fixed explosion rays getting stuck in empty subchunks (possible incorrect behaviour in large caves).
- Fixed bad tile/entity NBT data being propagated from world providers in some cases.
- Fixed a possible crash when detecting timezone on CentOS.
- Fixed many cases of incorrectly documented types in the API found by PHPStan.
- Generation tasks no longer assume that generator instances stored in TLS are always valid, fixing a possible crash.

## Protocol
- Fixed skin animation image corruption in LoginPacket handling caused by incorrect data handling.
- Fixed skin animation extra data not being decoded from LoginPacket.
- `SkinImage` now throws `InvalidArgumentException` if it receives an unexpected amount of bytes for the given image heigh/width.

- Added a specialized build script `build/server-phar.php` for creating server phars.
- Fixed timings crashing the server.
- Timings chains now work correctly.
- Fixed some minor timing errors in chained timings.
- Forcing resource packs no longer causes removal of client-sided resource packs. If this behaviour is desired, use a vanilla resource pack at the bottom of your resource stack (as was necessary for non-forced packs).

# 3.11.4
- Fixed performance issue in leaf decay.
- Fixed entity position desync when entities stop moving, but still have velocity on the client.
- Fixed a crash when encountering truncated `level.dat` files in LevelDB worlds.
- Core code is now analyzed using PHPStan level 6.
- The core constants `pocketmine\PATH` and `pocketmine\RESOURCE_PATH` are now unconditionally available when including the Composer autoloader.
- Populate type information in lots of places where it was previously missing; this will improve the quality of static analysis for plugins.

- `ClientboundMapItemDataPacket` now uses `MapDecoration` objects for decorations instead of associative arrays.
- Updated Composer dependencies to get bug fixes in `pocketmine/nbt` and other libraries.
- Packages `pocketmine/classloader` and `pocketmine/log` are now required; these provide classes previously part of `pocketmine/spl`. This change has no effect on API compatibility.

- Protocol: Fixed wrong order of fields in `UpdateTradePacket`.
- Protocol: Fixed loss of `fullSkinId` when decoding network skins.
- Fixed RCON not being able to bind to port after a fast server restart.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.14.60**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.12.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.14.60
- Removed compatibility with 1.14.0-1.14.30

# 3.12.1
- Fixed parsing of single-line doc comments for event handlers, e.g. `/** @ignoreCancelled */` should now work correctly.
- The server will no longer crash on failure to load `level.dat` contents, but will gracefully shutdown instead without producing a crashdump.
- Fixed some bugs in login verification that could cause undefined behaviour.
- Fixed item-use behaviour when sneaking - sneaking and clicking a block with an empty hand, and sneaking and using an item, both now follow vanilla behaviour.
- `start.sh` will now work on platforms where `/bin/bash` is not available, as long as `/usr/bin/env` knows where bash is.

# 3.12.2
- Fixed permission default timings not being reported in timings reports (they were never stopped, only started).
- Resource packs with a directory tree like `pack.zip/MyPack/manifest.json` are now supported. Note that the manifest closest to the root will be used.
- Fixed `SkinImage` height and width being inverted at the protocol layer.
- Fixed blocks being able to be placed inside the spawn protection radius by clicking the side of a block outside the radius.
- Fixed server crash when `network.compression-level` is overridden by a CLI parameter.
- Fixed moving entities spawning themselves to players registered on chunks when the players haven't received the chunk yet.
- Cocoa pods now drop cocoa beans when broken instead of the block itself.

# 3.12.3
- Core code is now analyzed using PHPStan level 8 (using baselines). While not all the code is level 8 compliant, this does mean that new code will be held to a higher standard, ensuring quality going forwards.
- Players no longer burn when melee-attacked by other players. (vanilla parity)
- Arrows shot by burning players are no longer on fire. (vanilla parity)
- Fixed a crash that could occur with plugins on Unix filesystems that had backslashes in their names.
- Cleaned up a whole bunch of unknowns in the protocol layer. Many new constants have been added.
- Fixed player walking sounds.
- Default generation queue size has been raised to 32 (previously 8). The previous default was selected in a time when PHP was much less performant than it is today, and in today's world it just needlessly slows things down.
- Double plants are now burned away by fire.
- Snow layers can now be stacked. (vanilla parity)
- Resource pack sending chunk size has been reduced to 128 KB (previously 1 MB). This change was made after analyzing the effects that larger pack chunk sizes have on RakNet. Given the technical evidence, a smaller size, while slightly less bandwidth-efficient, should be more manageable for RakNet due to lower split reassembly overhead and reduced memory pressure.
- Fixed "switching" (an exploit often complained about by PvP players). Now, the previous damage is subtracted from current damage when an entity is attacked while on cooldown. This means that attacking with a wooden sword and then diamond sword while attack cooldown is active will only deal as much damage as the diamond sword would have, instead of the combined total. This can be controlled using the `EntityDamageEvent::MODIFIER_PREVIOUS_DAMAGE_COOLDOWN` modifier. (vanilla parity)
- Fixed projectiles knocking mobs back in unexpected directions on collision.
- Fixed inventories not being synchronized on failed inventory transactions.
- Vector3s decoded from packets are no longer rounded directly. Instead, the player movement handler takes responsibility for rounding the coordinates to prevent anti cheat doing something it's not supposed to.
- `mobflame` particle can now be spawned using the `/particle` command.
- Fixed several internal errors that could occur while modifying writable books.
- Fixed swapping writable book pages not working in some cases.
- `WritableBook->getPageText()` no longer throws an exception when the page doesn't exist, but returns null (as it was originally intended to).

# 3.12.4
- Fixed absorption hearts not being consumed.

# 3.12.5
- Fixed broken attack cooldowns.

# 3.12.6
- Fixed entities not getting movement updates after teleports.
- Fixed slow flight in spectator mode when starting from the ground and after teleportation.
- Errors communicating with the crash archive on automatic crash submission are now logged.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.14.60**

This is a feature release, containing various minor API additions, deprecations and a few minor features.

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.13.0
## Core
- PHP 7.3.0 or newer is now required.
- Player movement processing has been revamped. It's now more tolerant of network lag and doesn't have as many problems with falling.

## User Interface
- `/time` now supports additional aliases `noon`, `sunset`, `midnight` and `sunrise`.
- Removed warnings when a plugin registers a handler for a deprecated event. Since this warning is developer-focused, and too specific to be useful, it just caused annoyance and confusion to users who didn't know what it meant.

## API
### General
- It's now possible to require a specific operating system using the `os` directive in `plugin.yml`. More information about this directive can be found in the [developer documentation](https://github.com/pmmp/DeveloperDocs).

### Player
- `Player->resetItemCooldown()` now accepts a second parameter, allowing plugins to provide a custom duration.
- The following methods have been deprecated and have recommended replacements:
  - `Player->addTitle()` -> `Player->sendTitle()`
  - `Player->addSubTitle()` -> `Player->sendSubTitle()`
  - `Player->addActionBarMessage()` -> `Player->sendActionBarMessage()`

### Event
- The following methods have been deprecated:
  - `EntityDespawnEvent->getType()`
  - `EntityDespawnEvent->getPosition()`
  - `EntityDespawnEvent->isCreature()`
  - `EntityDespawnEvent->isHuman()`
  - `EntityDespawnEvent->isProjectile()`
  - `EntityDespawnEvent->isVehicle()`
  - `EntityDespawnEvent->isItem()`
  - `EntitySpawnEvent->getType()`
  - `EntitySpawnEvent->getPosition()`
  - `EntitySpawnEvent->isCreature()`
  - `EntitySpawnEvent->isHuman()`
  - `EntitySpawnEvent->isProjectile()`
  - `EntitySpawnEvent->isVehicle()`
  - `EntitySpawnEvent->isItem()`
- Added the following API methods:
  - `EntityDeathEvent->getXpDropAmount()`
  - `EntityDeathEvent->setXpDropAmount()`
- `PlayerDeathEvent::__construct()` now accepts a fourth (optional) parameter `int $xp`.
- `EntityDeathEvent::__construct()` now accepts a third (optional) parameter `int $xp`.

### Inventory
- The following classes have been deprecated:
  - `Recipe`
- The following methods have been deprecated:
  - `CraftingManager->registerRecipe()`
  - `Recipe->registerToCraftingManager()` (and all its implementations)

### Item
- New `Enchantment` type ID constants have been added.
- `ItemFactory::fromStringSingle()` has been added. This works exactly the same as `ItemFactory::fromString()`, but it has a return type of `Item` instead of `Item|Item[]` (more static analysis friendly).

### Level
- Added the following API methods:
  - `Position->getLevelNonNull()`: this is the same as `Position->getLevel()`, but throws an `AssumptionFailedError` if the level is null or invalid (more static analysis friendly).
  - `Level->getTimeOfDay()`
- The following constants have been changed:
  - `Level::TIME_DAY` now has a value of `1000`
  - `Level::TIME_NIGHT` now has a value of `13000`
- Added the following constants:
  - `Level::TIME_MIDNIGHT`
  - `Level::TIME_NOON`
- The following types of particles now accept optional `Color` parameters in the constructor:
  - `EnchantParticle`
  - `InstantEnchantParticle`

### Network
- Added the following API methods:
  - `RakLibInterface->setPacketLimit()`

### Scheduler
AsyncTask thread-local storage has been improved, making it simpler and easier to use.
- `AsyncTask->fetchLocal()` no longer deletes stored thread-local data. Instead, the storage behaves more like properties, and gets deleted when the AsyncTask object goes out of scope.
- `AsyncTask->peekLocal()` has been `@deprecated` (use `fetchLocal()` instead).
- Notices are no longer emitted if an async task doesn't fetch its locally stored data.
- The following methods have been deprecated:
  - `AsyncTask->getFromThreadStore()` (use its worker's corresponding method)
  - `AsyncTask->saveToThreadStore()` (use its worker's corresponding method)
  - `AsyncTask->removeFromThreadStore()` (use its worker's corresponding method)

### Utils
- The following functions have been deprecated and have recommended replacements:
  - `Utils::getMemoryUsage()` -> split into `Process::getMemoryUsage()` and `Process::getAdvancedMemoryUsage()` (not 1:1 replacement!!)
  - `Utils::getRealMemoryUsage()` -> `Process::getRealMemoryUsage()`
  - `Utils::getThreadCount()` -> `Process::getThreadCount()`
  - `Utils::kill()` -> `Process::kill()`
  - `Utils::execute()` -> `Process::execute()`
- Added the following constants:
  - `Utils::OS_WINDOWS`
  - `Utils::OS_IOS`
  - `Utils::OS_MACOS`
  - `Utils::OS_ANDROID`
  - `Utils::OS_LINUX`
  - `Utils::OS_BSD`
  - `Utils::OS_UNKNOWN`
- Added the following API methods:
  - `Config->getPath()`
  - `Utils::recursiveUnlink()`
  - `Terminal::write()`
  - `Terminal::writeLine()`

# 3.13.1
- Fixed issues with `server.lock` not being unlocked on some platforms. Now, the server explicitly releases it before exiting.
- `/timings` now sends a usage message when using an unknown subcommand. Previously, it would just give no output.
- `/whitelist` now sends a usage message when using an unknown subcommand. Previously, it would just give no output.
- The output from `/timings` is now broadcasted on the `pocketmine.broadcast.admin` broadcast channel for auditability, similarly to other operator commands.
- Fixed `ShapedRecipe` deprecation warning on PHP 7.4.
- Fixed some potential crashes with Bedrock worlds when chunk data is corrupted or missing.
- Fixed a bug in region handling that caused region loaders to overestimate the amount of space used in the file. This resulted in an up to 4 MB growth of the file size every time the region was reloaded after writing a chunk.
- Region handlers now try to reuse free space in region files before putting the chunk at the end of the file. Previously, space was only reused if the new version of the chunk was <= the size of the old. This fixes endless growth of region files.
- Regions now never directly overwrite old copies of chunks when saving; instead they try to find an alternative location (preferring unused space within the file first). This avoids chunk corruption on power failure (the old copy of the chunk won't be damaged, so a rollback might occur instead), and as happy side effect, causes oversized regions to gradually shrink towards their most packed state over time, saving disk space.
- Regions now have a hard size cap at 64 GB. This is because the header pointers will overflow beyond 64 GB (besides, a normal region shouldn't be this big anyway).
- Fixed a crash that could occur when reading a too-short region header.
- `VerifyLoginTask` now only copies JWTs to verify instead of the entire login packet. This reduces the amount of data copied between threads, improving performance.
- Added a fast-fail check to `VerifyLoginTask` by checking the JWT header's `x5u` against the expected public key.
- `Skin->validate()` now throws `InvalidSkinException` instead of `\InvalidArgumentException`.
- A debug message is now logged when a player is kicked for having an invalid skin, giving a brief line of detail why.
- Fixed players not being kicked for having an invalid `resourcePatch`.
- Fixed block meta value of cake being preserved when using pick-block.
- Fixed explosions not fully destroying multi-block objects like beds and doors.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.0**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.14.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.0.
- Removed compatibility with 1.14.60.

## Known issues (please don't open issues for these)
- Walls don't connect to each other
- Pumpkin and melon stems may not connect to their corresponding pumpkin/melon
- New blocks, items & mobs aren't implemented
- Nether doesn't exist

# 3.14.1
- All skins are now trusted, bypassing the client-side trusted skin setting. Note that this means that NSFW skin filtering will **not** apply.
- Fixed projectile motion being altered by ladders.
- Fixed client-sided crashes when pressing E repeatedly very quickly on a high-latency connection.
- `/plugins`, `/whitelist list`, `/banlist` and `/list` now show output in alphabetical order.
- Some `pocketmine\event` APIs which accept arrays now have more robust type checking, fixing type errors caused by plugin input occurring in core code.
- `Attribute::getAttributeByName()` is now aware of the `minecraft:lava_movement` attribute.

# 3.14.2
- Exception stack traces are now logged as CRITICAL. It's hoped that users will recognize that they are just as important as the error message and not leave them out when asking for help with errors on Discord.
- `TaskScheduler` no longer accepts tasks that already have a handler. This fixes undefined behaviour which occurs when scheduling the same task instance twice, but it does break plugins such as **MyPlot** which unintentionally used this buggy behaviour.
- Players will now correctly receive the needed number of spawn chunks if they are teleported between `PlayerLoginEvent` and `PlayerJoinEvent`. This fixes a bug that could occur when teleporting players in delayed tasks between login and join.
- `PlayerRespawnEvent->setRespawnPosition()` now throws an exception if the provided `Position` has an invalid world associated with it (null or unloaded).
- Fixed a crash that occurred when stats reporting was enabled.

# 3.14.3
- Fixed deprecation error when running `/whitelist list` on PHP 7.4.
- Fixed podzol breaking animation being incorrect (incorrect hardness).
- `Entity::getSaveId()` now reports the class name in the message thrown for unregistered entities.
- Fixed `CraftingManager->validate()` producing different results when called multiple times for the same transaction.
- Fixed various issues with batch-crafting items using the recipe book and shift-clicking.
- `tests/plugins/PocketMine-DevTools` submodule has been renamed to `tests/plugins/DevTools`.

- Fixed various PHP 7.4 compatibility issues in Composer dependencies (primarily callback-validator).
- Fixed LevelDB worlds with corrupted `level.dat` crashing the server instead of failing gracefully.
- Fixed error spam when using strings for layers in flatworld presets (`e.g. bedrock,3xdirt,grass`).
- Fixed blocks not getting updated properly on explosions.
- Fixed `BlockGrowEvent` not being called when sugarcane grows.
- Potato crops now drop poisonous potatoes when harvested.
- Fixed the wrong number of potatoes being dropped when harvesting potato crops.
- Players no longer get pullbacks when sprinting on slabs, stairs and various other blocks when `player.anti-cheat.allow-movement-cheats` is set to `false`. (This bug has been around for over 5 years, so many of you will be used to its existence.)
- Fixed entity collision box calculation not taking clip distance into account.
- Entities now step up the correct height of the target block, instead of jumping into the air 0.6 blocks and falling back down.

# 3.15.2
- Fixed issues with preloading `SubChunk`.
- `/gc` and automatic garbage collection will now release unused heap blocks back to the OS. Previously, the PHP process might hold onto these blocks indefinitely even when not used, causing elevated real memory usage.
- Added some documentation to `FurnaceBurnEvent`.

# 3.15.3
- Fixed fall damage accumulation over continuous knockbacks (e.g. combo attacks in PvP).
- Fixed a bug in `Human->addXp()` that would cause a crash when saving player data.
- `Human->addXp()` will no longer modify the target's total XP if `PlayerExperienceChangeEvent` was cancelled.
- `AsyncPool->getTaskQueueSizes()` has been added to allow external detection of async pool overload. This is planned to be implemented as a core feature in the future, but it hasn't been done yet.
- `BaseInventory->canAddItem()` behaviour now matches `addItem()` by considering the max stack size of the given item.
- Fixed a bug in generator options handling for worlds loaded via `pocketmine.yml`. This fix has the following side effects:
  - It's now possible to provide generator options as an `options` key when loading a world via `pocketmine.yml`.
  - If generator options are not provided, the options from `server.properties` will be used, instead of using an empty preset. (It's not clear whether this is desired behaviour, but it was clearly intended, since there is code to do this which was broken until this release. As such, this behaviour is subject to change in the future.)
- Fixed a bug in region-based world loading where some files without filename extensions and names containing a region filename extension (e.g a file named `amca` in a McRegion world) would cause the world not to load. These files are now ignored.
- Default network compression level has been lowered to 6, due to level 7 being 25% more expensive for only a marginal improvement in bandwidth.
- Fixed a performance issue with chunk requesting when players trigger chunk generation on first join.
- Setup wizard will now always show IP information, even if the user chose to skip the setup wizard when prompted. (This doesn't affect `--no-wizard` in any way.)
- `Maximum memory (system)` is no longer reported in `/status` due to having a misleading output (it was the same as the current memory usage).
- The `Player Chunk Send` timer on timings reports now actually reports measurements of chunk sending, not chunk loading.
- A new parent timer `World Load` has been added to timings reports, which aggregates timings from `syncChunkLoad` and subtimings from all worlds.

# 3.15.4
- Fixed a bug in the inventory transaction system that caused the server to freeze under some circumstances.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.100**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 3.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.16.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.100.
- Removed compatibility with earlier versions.
- Added new custom composer commands `make-server` and `make-devtools` to ease setting up a development environment and building the server.

## Known issues (please don't open issues for these)
- Walls don't connect to each other
- Pumpkin and melon stems may not connect to their corresponding pumpkin/melon
- New blocks, items & mobs aren't implemented
- Nether doesn't exist

# 3.16.1
- Fixed incorrect encoding of skins in the protocol.
- `/version` no longer crashes when a plugin provides `string[]` for the `author` field in `plugin.yml`.
- `author` in `plugin.yml` now accepts arrays, just like `authors`.
- Fixed `HellBiome` never being registered.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.200**

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 3.17.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.16.200.
- Removed compatibility with earlier versions.

## Known issues (please don't open issues for these)
- Walls don't connect to each other
- Pumpkin and melon stems may not connect to their corresponding pumpkin/melon
- New blocks, items & mobs aren't implemented

- Hoes now take damage when used to break sponges.
- Using lava as fuel in a furnace now leaves behind an empty bucket.

# 3.17.2
- Fixed region header corruption when chunks with larger-than-expected lengths are found. These chunks are now treated as corrupted, instead of automatically attempting to salvage them (which usually fails anyway).
- `RegionLoader->removeChunk()` now allows the space used by the removed chunk to be reused by future region saves.
- Extracted `Living->applyConsumptionResults()` from `Living->consumeObject()` (preparation for a future bug fix).

# 3.17.3
- Improved performance of chunk loading in Region-based worlds.
- Improved performance of region header validation in Region-based worlds (indirect improvement to chunk loading performance).
- Fixed some PHP 8.0 language-level compatibility issues.
- Source installations will now exit with an error when Composer dependencies are not in sync with the current Git revision. Now, it's required to run `composer install` after every git pull to make sure the correct dependency versions are installed.

# 3.17.4
- Removed `readline` support. This hasn't been maintained for many years, never worked correctly, and isn't thread-safe in any case.
- Fixed false-positives of region corruption in Region-based worlds (outdated file stat cache).
- Fixed more deprecation warnings on PHP 8.0 (optional parameter before required).
- `CraftItemEvent->getInputs()` now returns a list starting at offset 0, instead of random offsets. (Note that the contents still won't be ordered.)
- `CraftItemEvent->getOutputs()` now returns a list starting at offset 0, instead of random offsets. (Note that the contents still won't be ordered.)
- Fixed a bug that broke synchronized building, bridging, towering and more.
- Objects in memory dumps no longer show inherited properties multiple times.

# 3.17.5
- Reduced CPU wastage by the logger thread.
- Fixed LevelDB deprecation errors on PHP 8.0.
- Added some protocol changes for 1.16.200 which were previously overlooked.
- Player XUIDs are now tracked. If a player's XUID does not match the previously recorded XUID when they next join the server, they will be kicked. This can be disabled by the `player.verify-xuid` setting in `pocketmine.yml`.
- `BUILDING.md` now has a note about `build/server-phar.php`'s compression bug (a bug in PHP).

# 3.17.6
- Fixed core race conditions that could have led to server freezes (race conditions in pmmp/Snooze).
- The log message about Xbox Live authentication being enabled has been reduced to INFO, and the tip on how to turn it off removed (disabling it should usually only be done by power users anyway).
- Fixed `PlayerMoveEvent->getFrom()` returning incorrect results for players who experienced movement reversions.
- Fixed a bug in `ResourcePackClientResponsePacket` decoding that caused unexpected results when decoding the packet twice.
- XUID verification now compares XUIDs against players who are already on the server to detect mismatches to avoid unnecessary loading of playerdata.
- Fixed an inventory duplication bug which could occur when the same player joined with two devices at the same time.
- Fixed cursor item not being synced on inventory transaction rollbacks.
- Fixed items with TAG_Float in their NBT not being able to be moved around in the inventory.

# 3.17.7
- Fixed crash caused by preprocessor in 3.17.6.

- Fixed server joining when default game mode is set to Spectator mode.
- Fixed items not being able to be removed from item frames in Survival mode.
- Fixed field order in ClientCacheBlobStatusPacket (hits and misses were inverted).
- Fixed a deadlock that could occur when MainLogger->syncFlushBuffer() was used (usually only used during exception logging).
- Updated constants for various things in the protocol.

# 3.18.2
- Fixed `InventoryCloseEvent` not being called on server-initiated inventory closures.
- `PlayerToggleFlightEvent` may now be pre-cancelled if the player attempted to enable flight when flying was not allowed. This replaces the previous behaviour of kicking the player.
- Fixed being unable to change the item in hand from the inventory window when looking at an entity.

- Fixed temporary memory leak of repeating tasks which cancelled themselves during their `onRun()` handler (they were pushed back onto the task queue even though cancelled, and only removed at their next attempted repeat).

# 3.19.2
- Signs can now only be edited by the player who placed them. They will become finalized if the chunk containing them is unloaded and reloaded, or if the creating player quits the server.

# 3.19.3

- Fixed items in the crafting grid getting deleted on server-side disconnect or session timeout.
- A warning is now logged on startup if a debug build of PHP is used to run the server (because it has a significant performance impact).
- GitHub Actions is now used to build new releases, instead of Jenkins. You can see build logs [here](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/actions/workflows/draft-release.yml).

# 3.22.3
- Fixed a bug in the release build of 3.22.2 which caused the crash archive to reject all crashdumps.
- Fixed possible server crash during player spawning.

# 3.22.4
- Fixed a bug which broke the build of 3.22.3.

# 3.22.5

# 3.25.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.17.40.
- Removed compatibility with earlier versions.

# 3.25.1
- Fixed autosave bug that caused unmodified chunks to be saved at least once (during the first autosave after they were loaded).
- `Entity->spawnTo()` now has an additional sanity check for matching worlds (might expose a few new errors in plugins).
- Fixed a missing field in `CraftRecipeAuto` item stack request type.

# 3.25.2
- Now analysed using level 9 on PHPStan 1.0.0.
- `ext-pthreads` v4.0.0 or newer is now required.
- Fixed crash in `Player->showPlayer()` when the target is not in the same world.

  - Note that the defective plugin(s) which caused this problem will still cause a server crash, but the plugin responsible will now get blamed correctly.

# 3.26.4
- Fixed skins appearing black when using RTX resource packs.
- Fixed chunks containing furnaces in old worlds (pre-2017) being discarded as corrupted.
  - This was caused by a strict corruption check detecting bad data created by a bug in PocketMine-MP that was fixed in 2017.

## Core
### General
- Remote console (RCON) has been removed. The [RconServer](https://github.com/pmmp/RconServer) plugin is provided as a substitute.
- Spawn protection has been removed. The [BasicSpawnProtection](https://github.com/pmmp/BasicSpawnProtection) plugin is provided as a substitute.
- Player movement anti-cheat has been removed.
- GS4 Query no longer breaks when disabling RakLib.
- PreProcessor is removed from builds due to high maintenance cost and low benefit. Its usage is now discouraged.
- The title bar no longer displays heap memory usage numbers (nobody seemed to know that was what it was, anyway).
- `start.sh` no longer specifically mentions PHP 7 when erroring because of a missing PHP binary.
- The `--bootstrap` CLI option has been removed.
- Introduced support for connecting via IPv6:
  - PHP binary used must now always be built with IPv6 support, even if IPv6 is disabled. This is because RakNet may still send link-local IPv6 loopback addresses in connection packets even when only using IPv4.
  - Port `19133` is used for IPv6 by default so that Minecraft Bedrock can detect IPv6 servers on LAN.
  - GS4 Query is supported on both IPv4 and IPv6 according to `server.properties` settings.
  - New `server.properties` options `enable-ipv6`, `server-ipv6`, `server-portv6` have been added (see below).

### Dependency changes
- The `pocketmine_chunkutils` PHP extension has been dropped.
- IPv6 support in PHP is now mandatory.
- New PHP extensions are required by this version:
  - [crypto](https://github.com/bukka/php-crypto)
  - [chunkutils2](https://github.com/pmmp/ext-chunkutils2)
  - [gmp](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php)
  - [igbinary](https://github.com/igbinary/igbinary)
  - [leveldb](https://github.com/pmmp/php-leveldb) (must be built with [pmmp/leveldb](https://github.com/pmmp/leveldb/tree/mojang-compatible))
  - [morton](https://github.com/pmmp/ext-morton)
- The following Composer dependency versions have changed (**PLEASE READ, dependency API changes are not mentioned in this changelog!**):
  - `pocketmine/bedrock-protocol` has been added at [7.0.0](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockProtocol/releases/tag/7.0.0+bedrock-1.18.0).
  - `pocketmine/classloader` has been updated from 0.1.0 to [0.2.0](https://github.com/pmmp/ClassLoader/releases/tag/0.2.0) (**significant API changes, new features**).

  - `pocketmine/nbt` has been updated from 0.2.18 to [0.3.0](https://github.com/pmmp/NBT/releases/tag/0.3.0) (**significant API changes**).
  - `pocketmine/raklib` has been updated from 0.12.7 to [0.14.2](https://github.com/pmmp/RakLib/releases/tag/0.14.2) (**significant API changes**, see also [0.13.0](https://github.com/pmmp/RakLib/releases/tag/0.13.0)).
  - `pocketmine/raklib-ipc` has been added at [0.1.0](https://github.com/pmmp/RakLibIpc/releases/tag/0.1.0) (components extracted from RakLib).
  - `pocketmine/snooze` has been updated from 0.1.0 to [0.3.0](https://github.com/pmmp/Snooze/releases/tag/0.3.0) (**minor API changes**, see also [0.2.0](https://github.com/pmmp/Snooze/releases/tag/0.2.0)).
  - `pocketmine/spl` has been dropped.
- Minecraft Bedrock protocol is now developed in a separate repository, [pmmp/BedrockProtocol](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockProtocol).
  - It has significant changes compared to PM3. Please read its changelogs.
- The following submodules have been removed:
  - `resources/vanilla`: BedrockData is now included via Composer dependency [`pocketmine/bedrock-data`](https://packagist.org/packages/pocketmine/bedrock-data).
  - `resources/locale`: Language files are now included via Composer dependency [`pocketmine/locale-data`](https://packagist.org/packages/pocketmine/locale-data).
  - This means it's now possible to run a server from git sources without cloning submodules :)
  - All remaining submodules (DevTools, build/php) are non-essential for building and running a server.

### Performance
- `/op`, `/deop`, `/whitelist add` and `/whitelist remove` no longer cause player data to be loaded from disk for no reason.
- Timings now use high-resolution timers provided by `hrtime()` to collect more accurate performance metrics.
- Closures are now used for internal event handler calls. This provides a performance improvement of 10-20% over the 3.x system, which had to dynamically resolve callables for every event call.
- Improved startup performance when loading many plugins.
- See more in the [Worlds / Performance](#performance-2) and [Network / Performance](#performance-3) sections.

### Tools
Some new scripts have been added in the `tools/` directory of the repository. These scripts may use the PocketMine-MP core library, but are intended to be run standalone.

 - `convert-world.php`: allows converting a world to a new format without a running server
 - `compact-regions.php`: repacks files in legacy Region worlds to clean up wasted disk space
 - `generate-permission-doc.php`: generates a Markdown document of all core permissions (see [example](https://gist.github.com/dktapps/eed6d6a4571f01b676236bf9ff2779b2))
 - `simulate-chunk-selector.php`: generates a series of images to visualize the behaviour of the chunk sending algorithm; these images can then be stitched into video using a tool such as [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

### Commands
- The `/effect` command no longer supports numeric IDs - it's now required to use names.
- The `/enchant` command no longer supports numeric IDs - it's now required to use names.
- The `/give` command no longer permits giving items with invalid NBT (e.g. incorrect types). Previously, this was the cause of random server crashes when using items on PM3.
- The `/give` command now supports many new aliases like in Java, e.g. it's now possible to do `/give someone bonemeal` or `/give someone lapis_lazuli` instead of using legacy id:metadata.
- The `/help` command is now localized according to language set in `server.properties`.
- The `/reload` command has been removed.
- The `/setworldspawn` command now accepts relative coordinates when used as a player.
- The `/status` command no longer displays heap memory usage numbers.
- Added `/clear` command with functionality equivalent to that of vanilla Minecraft.
- The following commands' outputs are now localized according to the chosen language settings:
  - `/gc`
  - `/status`
  - `/op`
  - `/deop`
- Fixed use of commands without the proper permission sending a message `commands.generic.permission` instead of the proper message.
- Fixed commands not working in some cases after using some control sequences on the console.
- Fixed `/setworldspawn` setting incorrect positions based on player position when in negative coordinates.

### Configuration
- World presets can now be provided as a `preset` key in `pocketmine.yml`, instead of putting them in the `generator` key.
- The `worlds` config no longer supports attaching the generator settings to the `generator` key (use the `preset` key instead).
- Using an unknown generator in `server.properties` or `pocketmine.yml` will now cause a failure to generate the world.
- Using invalid/incorrect world generator options (presets) in `server.properties` or `pocketmine.yml` will now cause a failure to generate the world.
- The following new options have been added to `pocketmine.yml`:
  - `chunk-ticking.blocks-per-subchunk-per-tick` (default `3`): Increasing this value will increase the rate at which random block updates happen (e.g. grass growth).
  - `network.enable-encryption` (default `true`): Controls whether Minecraft network packets are encrypted or not.
- The following options have been removed from `pocketmine.yml`:
  - `chunk-ticking.light-updates`: Since lighting is needed for basic vanilla functionality to work, allowing this to be disabled without disabling chunk ticking made no sense. If you don't want light calculation to occur, you can disable chunk ticking altogether by setting `chunk-ticking.per-tick` to `0` in `pocketmine.yml`.
  - `player.anti-cheat.allow-movement-cheats`
- The following new options have been added to `server.properties`:
  - `enable-ipv6`: `on` by default. Disabling this completely disables IPv6 support.
  - `server-ipv6`: `::` by default (equivalent to "any IP", like `0.0.0.0` for IPv4). Most users shouldn't need to change this setting, and it doesn't appear in `server.properties` by default.
  - `server-portv6`: `19133` by default. You may run both IPv4 and IPv6 on the same port, but since Bedrock scans on 19133 by default, PM also uses the same.

### World handling
#### Interface
- Progress of spawn terrain chunk generation is now logged during initial world creation.

#### Functional
- Minecraft Bedrock worlds up to 1.12.x are now supported. (1.13+ are still **not supported** due to yet another format change, which is large and requires a lot of work).
- Automatic conversion of deprecated world formats is now implemented.
- All formats except `leveldb` have been deprecated. The following world formats will be **automatically converted on load to a new format**:
  - `mcregion`
  - `anvil`
  - `pmanvil`
- Generator options of existing worlds are now validated before loading them. If they are invalid, the server will fail to load them.
- Fixed the server attempting to generate a world if it failed to load.
- 256 build-height is now supported in all worlds (facilitated by automatic conversion).
- Extended blocks are now supported (facilitated by automatic conversion).
- The server will now attempt to translate invalid blocks to valid equivalents when loading chunks. This fixes many issues with `update!` blocks appearing in worlds, particularly ghost structures (these would appear when world editors previously erased some blocks by setting their IDs but not metadata).
- Lighting is no longer stored or loaded from disk - instead, it's calculated on the fly as-needed. This fixes many long-standing bugs.
- Explosions now use the standard mechanism for processing block updates. Previously, it used a special mechanism due to prohibitively poor efficiency of the standard algorithm. Since these inefficiencies have now been addressed, explosions can now be consistent with everything else, with minimal performance impact.
- Fixed debug spam of `chunk has no loaders registered` messages during chunk generation.
- Various cases of corrupted data in chunks will now cause an error to be logged instead of a server crash. This includes tiles with colliding positions and tiles in incorrect, non-loaded chunks.
- Fixed players re-requesting the same ungenerated chunks multiple times before they were sent.
- Fixed players re-requesting chunks when turning their heads or jumping.

#### Performance
- `leveldb` is now the primary supported world format. It is inherently faster than region-based formats thanks to better design.
- Partial chunk saves (only saving modified subcomponents of chunks) has been implemented. This drastically reduces the amount of data that is usually necessary to write on chunk save, which in turn **drastically reduces the time to complete world saves**. This is possible thanks to the modular design of the `leveldb` world format - this enhancement is not possible with region-based formats.
- Lighting is no longer guaranteed to be available on every chunk. It's now calculated on the fly as-needed.
- Z-order curves (morton codes) are now used for block and chunk coordinate hashes. This substantially improves performance in many areas by resolving a hashtable key hash collision performance issue. Affected areas include explosions, light calculation, and more.
- Improved performance of `World->setBlock()` by around 35% when the `$update` parameter is set to `true`.
- Improved performance of `World->setBlock()` by around 30% when the `$update` parameter is set to `false`.

### Logging
- Many components now have a dedicated logger which automatically adds [prefixes] to their messages.
- Main logger now includes milliseconds in timestamps.
- Debug messages are now logged when reach distance checks prevent players from doing something.
- Various messages related to world loading/generation/conversion and plugin loading errors are now localized according to the language set in `server.properties`.
- Exception log format has been changed. Now, exception info is logged in one big block message. This saves space on the console and improves readability, as well as reducing the ability for bad `ThreadedLoggerAttachment`s to break exception output.
- Improved error messages when a plugin command name or alias contains an illegal character.
- The server will now log an EMERGENCY-level message when `Server->forceShutdown()` is used for any other reason than a graceful shutdown.

### Network
This version features substantial changes to the network system, improving coherency, reliability and modularity.

#### Performance
- [`libdeflate`](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate) is now (optionally) used for outbound Minecraft packet compression. It's more than twice as fast as zlib in most cases, providing significant performance boosts to packet broadcasts and overall network performance.

#### Minecraft Bedrock packet encryption
- This fixes replay attacks where hackers steal and replay player logins.
- A new setting has been added to `pocketmine.yml`: `network.enable-encryption` which is `true` by default.

#### Error handling
- Only `BadPacketException` is now caught during packet decode and handling. This requires that all decoding MUST perform proper data error checking.
  - Throwing a `BadPacketException` from decoding will now cause players to be kicked with the message `Packet processing error`.
  - The disconnect message includes a random hex ID to help server owners identify the problems reported by their players.
- Throwing any other exception will now cause a server crash. `Internal server error` has been removed.
- It is now illegal to send a clientbound packet to the server. Doing so will result in the client being kicked with the message `Unexpected non-serverbound packet`.
- Fixed server crash when unable to bind to the desired port. Now, the server will show an error and gracefully stop without a crashdump instead.

#### New packet handler system
- Packet handlers have been separated from NetworkSession into a dedicated packet handler structure.
- A network session may have exactly 1 handler at a time, which is mutable and may be replaced at any time. This allows packet handling logic to be broken up into multiple stages:
  - preventing undefined behaviour when sending wrong packets at the wrong time (they'll now be silently dropped)
  - allowing the existence of ephemeral state-specific logic (for example stricter resource packs download checks)
- Packet handlers are now almost entirely absent from `Player` and instead appear in their own dedicated units.
- Almost all game logic that was previously locked up inside packet handlers in `Player` has been extracted into new API methods. See Player API changes for details.

### Plugin loading
- Phar plugins are now able to depend on folder plugins loaded by DevTools.
- A new "plugin greylist" feature has been introduced, which allows whitelisting or blacklisting plugins from loading. See `plugin_list.yml`.

### Internals
- The `pocketmine` subdirectory has been removed from `src`. [PSR-4 autoloading is now used thanks to Composer](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.0.0/composer.json#L63).
- Crashdump rendering has been separated from crashdump data generation. This allows rendering crashdumps from existing JSON data.
- Direct iteration of arrays with string keys is now disallowed by a custom PHPStan rule. This is because numeric strings are casted to integers when used as array keys, which produces a variety of unexpected behaviour particularly for iteration.
  - To iterate on arrays with string keys, `Utils::stringifyKeys()` must now be used.
- Fixed various crashes involving arrays with numeric string keys.

## API
### General
- Most places which previously allowed `callable` now only allow `\Closure`. This is because closures have more consistent behaviour and are more performant.
- `void` and `?nullable` parameter and return types have been applied in many places.
- Everything in the `pocketmine\metadata` namespace and related implementations have been removed.

### Changes to `plugin.yml`
#### Permission nesting
Permission nesting is no longer supported in `plugin.yml`. Grouping permissions (with defaults) in `plugin.yml` had very confusing and inconsistent behaviour.
Instead of nesting permission declarations, they should each be declared separately.

_Before_:
```
permissions:
   pmmp:
     default: op
	 children:
	     pmmp.something:
		     default: op
         pmmp.somethingElse
		     default: op
```

_After_:
```
permissions:
    pmmp.something:
        default: op
    pmmp.somethingElse
        default: op
```

#### `src-namespace-prefix`
A new directive `src-namespace-prefix` has been introduced. This allows you to get rid of those useless subdirectories in a plugin's structure.
For example, a plugin whose main was `pmmp\TesterPlugin\Main` used to have to be structured like this:
```
|-- plugin.yml
|-- src/
    |-- pmmp/
        |-- TesterPlugin/
            |-- Main.php
            |-- SomeOtherClass.php
            |-- SomeNamespace/
                |-- SomeNamespacedClass.php
```
However, if we add `src-namespace-prefix: pmmp\TesterPlugin` to the `plugin.yml`, now we can get rid of the useless directories and structure it like this instead:
```
|-- plugin.yml
|-- src/
    |-- Main.php
    |-- SomeOtherClass.php
    |-- SomeNamespace/
        |-- SomeNamespacedClass.php
```

**Note**: The old structure will also still work just fine. This is not a required change.

### Other changes
- Incorrect structure of `commands` is now detected earlier and handled more gracefully.
- Commands must now declare `permission` for each command. Previously, the `permission` key was optional, causing anyone to be able to use the command.
  - This behaviour was removed because of the potential for security issues - a typo in `plugin.yml` could lead to dangerous functionality being exposed to everyone.
  - If you want to make a command that everyone can use, declare a permission with a `default` of `true` and assign it to the command.
- Permissions must now declare `default` for each permission. Previously, the `default` key was optional, causing the permission to silently be denied to everyone (PM4) or granted to ops implicitly (PM3).

### Block
- A new `VanillaBlocks` class has been added, which contains static methods for creating any currently-known block type. This should be preferred instead of use of `BlockFactory::get()` where constants were used.
- `BlockFactory` is now a singleton, and its methods are no longer static. `BlockFactory::whatever()` should be replaced with `BlockFactory::getInstance()->whatever()`.
- `BlockFactory->get()` is now **deprecated**.
  - For most cases, `VanillaBlocks::WHATEVER_BLOCK()` should fill your needs.
  - `BlockFactory` should now only be used for loading old save data from, for example, a database, config or a world save.
  - To refer to blocks by name, consider using `StringToItemParser` to accept names instead of IDs.
- Blocks now contain their positions instead of extending `Position`. `Block->getPosition()` has been added.
- Blocks with IDs >= 256 are now supported.
- Block state and variant metadata have been separated.
  - Variant is considered an extension of ID and is immutable.
  - `Block->setDamage()` has been removed.
- All blocks now have getters and setters for their appropriate block properties, such as facing, lit/unlit, colour (in some cases), and many more. These should be used instead of metadata.
- Tile entities are now created and deleted automatically when `World->setBlock()` is used with a block that requires a tile entity.
- Some tile entities' API has been exposed on their corresponding `Block` classes, with the tile entity classes being deprecated.
- The `pocketmine\tile` namespace has been relocated to `pocketmine\block\tile`.
- `Block->recalculateBoundingBox()` and `Block->recalculateCollisionBoxes()` are now expected to return AABBs relative to `0,0,0` instead of their own position.
- Block break-info has been extracted into a new dynamic `BlockBreakInfo` unit. The following methods have been moved:
  - `Block->getBlastResistance()` -> `BlockBreakInfo->getBlastResistance()`
  - `Block->getBreakTime()` -> `BlockBreakInfo->getBreakTime()`
  - `Block->getHardness()` -> `BlockBreakInfo->getHardness()`

- The following API methods have been added:
  - `Block->asItem()`: returns an itemstack corresponding to the block
  - `Block->getModelPositionOffset()`: used to offset the bounding box of blocks like bamboo based on coordinates
  - `Block->isSameState()`: returns whether the block is the same as the parameter, including state information
  - `Block->isSameType()`: returns whether the block is the same as the parameter, without state information
  - `Block->isFullCube()`
  - `Liquid->getMinAdjacentSourcesToFormSource()`: returns how many adjacent source blocks of the same liquid must be present in order for the current block to become a source itself
- The following hooks have been added:
  - `Block->onAttack()`: called when a player in survival left-clicks the block to try to start breaking it
  - `Block->onEntityLand()`: called when an entity lands on this block after falling (from any distance)
  - `Block->onPostPlace()`: called directly after placement in the world, handles things like rail connections and chest pairing
- The following API methods have been renamed:
  - `Block->getDamage()` -> `Block->getMeta()`
  - `Block->onActivate()` -> `Block->onInteract()`
  - `Block->onEntityCollide()` -> `Block->onEntityInside()`
- The following API methods have changed signatures:
  - `Block->onInteract()` now has the signature `onInteract(Item $item, int $face, Vector3 $clickVector, ?Player $player = null) : bool`
  - `Block->getCollisionBoxes()` is now final. Classes should override `recalculateCollisionBoxes()`.
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `Block->canPassThrough()`
  - `Block->setDamage()`
  - `Block::get()`: this was superseded by `BlockFactory::get()` a long time ago
  - `Block->getBoundingBox()`
- The following classes have been added:
  - `inventory\CraftingTableInventory`: represents a crafting table's 3x3 crafting grid
  - `utils\LeverFacing`

### Command
- The following classes have been removed:
  - `PluginIdentifiableCommand` - use `PluginOwned` and `PluginOwnedTrait`
  - `RemoteConsoleCommandSender`
- The following API methods have signature changes:
  - `Command->setPermission()` argument is now mandatory (but still nullable).
  - `CommandSender->setScreenLineHeight()` argument is now mandatory (but still nullable).
  - `Command->getDescription()` now returns `Translatable|string`.
  - `Command->getUsage()` now returns `Translatable|string`.
  - `Command->setDescription()` now accepts `Translatable|string`.
  - `Command->setUsage()` now accepts `Translatable|string`.
- `Command->setPermission()` now throws an exception if given a string containing non-existing permissions. Previously, it would silently default to allowing ops to use the command, which may not have been desired.
  - This is usually caused by a typo or forgotten permission declaration.
- Commands with spaces in the name are no longer supported.
- Command usage strings and description strings are no longer automatically translated (use `Translatable` instead of bare string keys).

### Entity
#### General
- `Entity` no longer extends from `Location`. `Entity->getLocation()` and `Entity->getPosition()` should be used instead.
- Ender inventory has been refactored. It's now split into two parts:
  - `EnderChestInventory` is a temporary gateway "inventory" that acts as a proxy to the player's ender inventory. It has a `Position` for holder. This is discarded when the player closes the inventory window.
  - `PlayerEnderInventory` is the storage part. This is stored in `Human` and does not contain any block info.
  - To open the player's ender inventory, use `Player->setCurrentWindow(new EnderChestInventory($blockPos, $player->getEnderInventory()))`.
- The following public fields have been removed:
  - `Entity->chunk`: Entities no longer know which chunk they are in (the `World` now manages this instead).
  - `Entity->height`: moved to `EntitySizeInfo`; use `Entity->size` instead
  - `Entity->width`: moved to `EntitySizeInfo`; use `Entity->size` instead

- The following methods have signature changes:
  - `Entity->entityBaseTick()` is now `protected`.
  - `Entity->move()` is now `protected`.
  - `Entity->setPosition()` is now `protected` (use `Entity->teleport()` instead).
  - `Entity->setPositionAndRotation()` is now `protected` (use `Entity->teleport()` instead).
  - `Living->knockBack()` now accepts `float, float, float` (the first two parameters have been removed).
  - `Living->getEffects()` now returns `EffectManager` instead of `Effect[]`.
  - `Location->__construct()` now accepts `?World $world` in the 4th parameter, and all parameters are now mandatory.
- The following classes have been added:
  - `effect\EffectManager`: contains effect-management functionality extracted from `Living`
  - `HungerManager`: contains hunger-management functionality extracted from `Human`
  - `ExperienceManager`: contains XP-management functionality extracted from `Human`
- The following API methods have been moved / renamed:
  - `Entity->fall()` -> `Entity->onHitGround()` (and visibility changed to `protected` from `public`)
  - `Living->removeAllEffects()` -> `EffectManager->clear()`

  - `Human->addSaturation()` -> `HungerManager->addSaturation()`
  - `Human->getExhaustion()` -> `HungerManager->getExhaustion()`
  - `Human->setExhaustion()` -> `HungerManager->setExhaustion()`
  - `Human->exhaust()` -> `HungerManager->exhaust()`
  - `Human->getXpLevel()` -> `ExperienceManager->getXpLevel()`
  - `Human->setXpLevel()` -> `ExperienceManager->setXpLevel()`
  - `Human->addXpLevels()` -> `ExperienceManager->addXpLevels()`

  - `Human->setCurrentTotalXp()` -> `ExperienceManager->setCurrentTotalXp()`
  - `Human->addXp()` -> `ExperienceManager->addXp()`
  - `Human->subtractXp()` -> `ExperienceManager->subtractXp()`
  - `Human->getLifetimeTotalXp()` -> `ExperienceManager->getLifetimeTotalXp()`
  - `Human->setLifetimeTotalXp()` -> `ExperienceManager->setLifetimeTotalXp()`
  - `Human->canPickupXp()` -> `ExperienceManager->canPickupXp()`
  - `Human->onPickupXp()` -> `ExperienceManager->onPickupXp()`
  - `Human->resetXpCooldown()` -> `ExperienceManager->resetXpCooldown()`
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `Human->getRawUniqueId()`: use `Human->getUniqueId()->getBytes()` instead
- The following classes have been removed:
  - `Creature`
  - `Damageable`
  - `Monster`
  - `NPC`
  - `Rideable`
  - `Vehicle`
- `Skin` now throws exceptions on creation if given invalid data.
- Fixed `Living->lookAt()` not taking eye height into account.

#### Effect
- All `Effect` related classes have been moved to the `pocketmine\entity\effect` namespace.
- Effect functionality embedded in the `Effect` class has been separated out into several classes. The following classes have been added:
  - `AbsorptionEffect`
  - `HealthBoostEffect`
  - `HungerEffect`
  - `InstantDamageEffect`
  - `InstantEffect`
  - `InstantHealthEffect`
  - `InvisibilityEffect`
  - `LevitationEffect`
  - `PoisonEffect`
  - `RegenerationEffect`
  - `SaturationEffect`
  - `SlownessEffect`
  - `SpeedEffect`
  - `WitherEffect`
- `VanillaEffects` class has been added. This exposes all vanilla effect types as static methods, replacing the old `Effect::getEffect()` nastiness.
  - Example: `Effect::getEffect(Effect::NIGHT_VISION)` can be replaced by `VanillaEffects::NIGHT_VISION()`.
- Negative effect amplifiers are now explicitly disallowed due to undefined behaviour they created.
- The boundaries between MCPE effect IDs and PocketMine-MP internals are now more clear.
  - ID handling is moved to `pocketmine\data\bedrock\EffectIdMap`.
  - All effect ID constants have been removed from `Effect`. `pocketmine\data\bedrock\EffectIds` if you still need legacy effect IDs for some reason.
- The following API methods have been moved:
  - `Effect->getId()` -> `EffectIdMap->toId()`
  - `Effect::registerEffect()` -> `EffectIdMap->register()`
  - `Effect::getEffect()` -> `EffectIdMap->fromId()`
  - `Effect::getEffectByName()` -> `StringToEffectParser->parse()`
- Added `StringToEffectParser` singleton:
  - Supports custom aliases!
  - This is used by `/effect` to provide name support.

#### Removal of runtime entity NBT
- Entities no longer keep their NBT alive at runtime.
  - `Entity->namedtag` has been removed.
  - `Entity->saveNBT()` now returns a newly created `CompoundTag` instead of modifying the previous one in-place.
  - `Entity->initEntity()` now accepts a `CompoundTag` parameter.

#### Entity creation
- `Entity::createEntity()` has been removed. It's no longer needed for creating new entities at runtime - just use `new YourEntity` instead.
- `Entity` subclass constructors can now have any signature, just like a normal class.
- Loading entities from NBT is now handled by `EntityFactory`. It works quite a bit differently than `Entity::createEntity()` did. Instead of registering `YourEntity::class` to a set of Minecraft save IDs, you now need to provide a callback which will construct an entity when given some NBT and a `World`.
  - `EntityFactory` is a singleton. You can get its instance by using `EntityFactory::getInstance()`.
  - Creation callbacks are registered using `EntityFactory->register()`.
  - Creation callbacks must have the signature `function(World, CompoundTag) : Entity`.
  - This enables `Entity` subclasses to have any constructor parameters they like.
  - It also allows requiring that certain data is always provided (for example, it doesn't make much sense to create a `FallingBlock` without specifying what type of block).
  - Examples:
    - `ItemEntity` now requires an `Item` in its constructor, so its creation callback decodes the `Item` from the NBT to be passed to the constructor.
    - `Painting` now requires a `PaintingMotive` in its constructor, so its creation callback decides which `PaintingMotive` to provide based on the NBT it receives.
    - See `EntityFactory` for more examples.
- `EntityFactory->register()` (previously `Entity::registerEntity()`) will now throw exceptions on error cases instead of returning `false`.
- The following API methods have been moved:
  - `Entity::registerEntity()` -> `EntityFactory->register()`
- The following classes have changed constructors:
  - All projectile subclasses now require a `?Entity $thrower` parameter.
  - `Arrow->__construct()` now requires a `bool $critical` parameter (in addition to the `$thrower` parameter).
  - `ExperienceOrb->__construct()` now requires a `int $xpValue` parameter.
  - `FallingBlock->__construct()` now requires a `Block $block` parameter.
  - `ItemEntity->__construct()` now requires an `Item $item` parameter.
  - `Painting->__construct()` now requires a `PaintingMotive $motive` parameter.
  - `SplashPotion->__construct()` now requires a `int $potionId` parameter.
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `Entity::createBaseNBT()`: `new YourEntity` and appropriate API methods should be used instead
  - `Entity->getSaveId()`
  - `Entity::getKnownEntityTypes()`
  - `Entity::createEntity()`: use `new YourEntity` instead (to be reviewed)

#### WIP removal of entity network metadata
- All network metadata related constants have been removed from the `Entity` class and moved to the protocol layer. It is intended to remove network metadata from the API entirely, but this has not yet been completed.
  - `Entity::DATA_FLAG_*` constants have been moved to `pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol\types\entity\EntityMetadataFlags`.
  - `Entity::DATA_TYPE_*` constants have been moved to `pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol\types\entity\EntityMetadataTypes`.
  - `Entity::DATA_*` constants have been moved to `pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol\types\entity\EntityMetadataProperties`.
- `DataPropertyManager` has been moved to the `pocketmine\network\mcpe\protocol\types\entity` namespace, and as such isn't considered part of the API anymore.
- Introduced internal `Entity` hook `syncNetworkData()`. This function is expected to synchronize entity properties with the entity's network data set.
- Internal usage of network metadata sets to store internal entity properties has been removed. Entities are now expected to use regular class properties and synchronize with the network data set as-asked.
- `Entity->propertyManager` has been renamed to `Entity->networkProperties`.
- `Entity->getDataPropertyManager()` has been renamed to `Entity->getNetworkProperties()`.

### Event
#### Internal event system no longer depends on `Listener`s
- The internal event processing system no longer depends on `Listener` objects. Arbitrary closures can now be used, provided that they satisfy the standard requirements to be a handler.
  - This change improves performance of event handler calling by approximately 15%. This does not include anything plugins are doing.
  - The following classes have been removed:
    - `pocketmine\plugin\EventExecutor`
    - `pocketmine\plugin\MethodEventExecutor`
  - `RegisteredListener->__construct()` now requires `Closure` instead of `Listener, EventExecutor` as the leading parameters.
  - `RegisteredListener->getListener()` has been removed.

#### Default cancelled handling behaviour has changed
- Handler functions will now **not receive cancelled events by default**. This is a **silent BC break**, i.e. it won't raise errors, but it might cause bugs.
- `@ignoreCancelled` is now no longer respected.
- `@handleCancelled` has been added. This allows opting _into_ receiving cancelled events (it's the opposite of `@ignoreCancelled`).
  - `@handleCancelled` may not be used on non-cancellable events (an exception will be thrown during registration).

#### `PlayerPreLoginEvent` changes
- The `Player` object no longer exists at this phase of the login. Instead, a `PlayerInfo` object is provided, along with connection information.
- Ban, server-full and whitelist checks are now centralized to `PlayerPreLoginEvent`. It's no longer necessary (or possible) to intercept `PlayerKickEvent` to handle these types of disconnects.
  - Multiple kick reasons may be set to ensure that the player is still removed if there are other reasons for them to be disconnected and one of them is cleared. For example, if a player is banned and the server is full, clearing the ban flag will still cause the player to be disconnected because the server is full.
  - Plugins may set custom kick reasons. Any custom reason has absolute priority.
  - If multiple flags are set, the kick message corresponding to the highest priority reason will be shown. The priority (as of this snapshot) is as follows:
    - Custom (highest priority)
    - Server full
    - Whitelisted
    - Banned
  - The `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_PRIORITY` constant contains a list of kick reason priorities, highest first.
- The following constants have been added:
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_PLUGIN`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_SERVER_FULL`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_SERVER_WHITELISTED`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_BANNED`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent::KICK_REASON_PRIORITY`: ordered list of kick reason priorities, highest first
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->clearAllKickReasons()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->clearKickReason()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getFinalKickMessage()`: the message to be shown to the player with the current reason list in place
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getIp()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getKickReasons()`: returns an array of flags indicating kick reasons, must be empty to allow joining
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getPlayerInfo()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getPort()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->isAllowed()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->isAuthRequired()`: whether XBL authentication will be enforced
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->isKickReasonSet()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->setAuthRequired()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->setKickReason()`
- The following API methods have been changed:
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getKickMessage()` now has the signature `getKickMessage(int $flag) : ?string`
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->setKickMessage()`
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getPlayer()`
- The following API methods have been moved / renamed:
  - `InventoryPickupItemEvent->getItem()` -> `InventoryPickupItemEvent->getItemEntity()`

#### Other changes
- Disconnecting players during events no longer crashes the server (although it might cause other side effects).
- Cancellable events must now implement `CancellableTrait` to get the cancellable components needed to satisfy interface requirements. `Event` no longer stubs these methods.
- `PlayerInteractEvent` is no longer fired when a player activates an item. This fixes the age-old complaint of `PlayerInteractEvent` firing multiple times when interacting once. The following constants have been removed:
  - `PlayerInteractEvent::LEFT_CLICK_AIR`
  - `PlayerInteractEvent::RIGHT_CLICK_AIR`
  - `PlayerInteractEvent::PHYSICAL`
- The following events have been added:
  - `BlockTeleportEvent`: block teleporting, for example dragon egg when attacked.
  - `EntityItemPickupEvent`: player (or other entity) picks up a dropped item (or arrow). Replaces `InventoryPickupItemEvent` and `InventoryPickupArrowEvent`.
    - Unlike its predecessors, this event supports changing the destination inventory.
    - If the destination inventory is `null`, the item will be destroyed. This is usually seen for creative players with full inventories.
  - `EntityTrampleFarmlandEvent`: mob (or player) jumping on farmland causing it to turn to dirt
  - `PlayerDisplayNameChangeEvent`
  - `PlayerEmoteEvent`
  - `PlayerEntityInteractEvent`: player right-clicking (or long-clicking on mobile) on an entity.
  - `PlayerItemUseEvent`: player activating their held item, for example to throw it.
  - `StructureGrowEvent`: called when trees or bamboo grow (or any other multi-block plant structure).
- The following events have changed behaviour:
  - Bone meal is now consistently never consumed when `BlockGrowEvent` or `StructureGrowEvent` is cancelled.
  - `BlockGrowEvent` is now called when cocoa pods grow.
  - `ChunkPopulateEvent` is now called after all adjacent chunks modified during population have been updated. This fixes issues with modifications made in the event sometimes disappearing.
  - `InventoryOpenEvent` is now fired when a player opens a crafting table's UI.
  - `InventoryCloseEvent` is now fired when a player closes a crafting table's UI.
  - `PlayerDropItemEvent` will now prevent the drops from force-closing of the following inventories:
    - anvil
    - enchanting table
    - loom
  - `PlayerKickEvent` is no longer fired for disconnects that occur before the player completes the initial login sequence (i.e. completing downloading resource packs).
- The following events have been removed:
  - `EntityArmorChangeEvent`
  - `EntityInventoryChangeEvent`
  - `EntityLevelChangeEvent` - `EntityTeleportEvent` with world checks should be used instead.

  - `PlayerCheatEvent`
  - `PlayerIllegalMoveEvent`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `EntityDeathEvent->getXpDropAmount()`
  - `EntityDeathEvent->setXpDropAmount()`
  - `PlayerDeathEvent->getXpDropAmount()`
  - `PlayerDeathEvent->setXpDropAmount()`
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->getPlayer()`
  - `Cancellable->setCancelled()`: this allows implementors of `Cancellable` to implement their own cancellation mechanisms, such as the complex one in `PlayerPreLoginEvent`
- The following API methods have been moved:
  - `Event->isCancelled()` -> `CancellableTrait->isCancelled()`: this was a stub which threw `BadMethodCallException` if the class didn't implement `Cancellable`; now this is simply not available on non-cancellable events
  - `Event->setCancelled()` has been split into `cancel()` and `uncancel()`, and moved to `CancellableTrait`
  - `HandlerList::unregisterAll()` -> `HandlerListManager->unregisterAll()`
  - `HandlerList::getHandlerListFor()` -> `HandlerListManager->getListFor()`
  - `HandlerList::getHandlerLists()` -> `HandlerListManager->getAll()`
- The following API methods have changed behaviour:
  - `PlayerCreationEvent->setPlayerClass()` now verifies that the player class set is instantiable.
- The following classes have been moved:
  - `pocketmine\plugin\RegisteredListener` -> `pocketmine\event\RegisteredListener`

### Inventory

- The following classes have been added:
  - `CallbackInventoryChangeListener`
  - `CreativeInventory`: contains the creative functionality previously embedded in `pocketmine\item\Item`, see Item changes for details
  - `InventoryChangeListener`: allows listening (but not interfering with) events in an inventory.
  - `PlayerCraftingInventory`: represents the player's own 2x2 crafting grid.

  - `BaseInventory->getDefaultSize()`
  - `BaseInventory->setSize()`
  - `CraftingGrid->getHolder()`
  - `EnderChestInventory->setHolderPosition()`
  - `Inventory->close()`
  - `Inventory->dropContents()`
  - `Inventory->getName()`
  - `Inventory->getTitle()`

  - `InventoryAction->execute()` now returns `void` instead of `bool`.
- `PlayerInventory->setItemInHand()` now sends the update to viewers of the player.
- `CraftingGrid` is now abstract.

### Item
#### General
- A new `VanillaItems` class has been added, which contains static methods for creating any currently-known item type. This should be preferred instead of use of `ItemFactory::get()` where constants were used.
- `StringToItemParser` singleton has been added:
  - This allows mapping any string to any item, irrespective of IDs
  - These mappings are used by `/give` and `/clear`, and are made with custom plugin aliases in mind.
  - Yes, this means you can finally add your own custom aliases to `/give` without ugly hacks!
- `LegacyStringToItemParser` singleton has been added. This supports id:meta parsing in the same way that `ItemFactory::fromString()` used to, but its use is discouraged.
- `ItemFactory` is now a singleton instead of static class, and its remaining methods are no longer static. You can get its instance by `ItemFactory::getInstance()`.
- `Item->count` is no longer public.
- The hierarchy of writable books has been changed: `WritableBook` and `WrittenBook` now extend `WritableBookBase`.
- The following API methods have signature changes:

  - `Potion::LONG_REGENERATION`
  - `Potion::STRONG_REGENERATION`
  - `Potion::STRENGTH`
  - `Potion::LONG_STRENGTH`
  - `Potion::STRONG_STRENGTH`
  - `Potion::WEAKNESS`
  - `Potion::LONG_WEAKNESS`
  - `Potion::WITHER`
- The following methods have been renamed:
  - `Item->getDamage()` -> `Item->getMeta()`
- The following methods have been moved to `pocketmine\inventory\CreativeInventory`:
  - `Item::addCreativeItem()` -> `CreativeInventory::add()`
  - `Item::clearCreativeItems()` -> `CreativeInventory::clear()`
  - `Item::getCreativeItemIndex()` -> `CreativeInventory::getItemIndex()`
  - `Item::getCreativeItems()` -> `CreativeInventory::getAll()`

  - `IronLeggings`
  - `LeatherBoots`
  - `LeatherCap`
  - `LeatherPants`
  - `LeatherTunic`

#### NBT handling
- Serialized NBT byte array caches are no longer stored on itemstacks. These caches were a premature optimization used for network layer serialization and as such were dependent on the network NBT format.
- Internal NBT usage has been marginalized. It's no longer necessary to immediately write changes to NBT. The following hooks have been added:
  - `Item->serializeCompoundTag()`
  - `Item->deserializeCompoundTag()`
- It's planned to remove runtime NBT from items completely, but this currently presents unresolved backwards-compatibility problems.

#### Enchantment
- `VanillaEnchantments` class has been added. This exposes all vanilla enchantment types as static methods, replacing the old `Enchantment::get()` nastiness.
  - Example: `Enchantment::get(Enchantment::PROTECTION)` is replaced by `VanillaEnchantments::PROTECTION()`
  - These methods also provide proper type information to static analysers instead of just generic `Enchantment`, making them easier to code with.
- The boundaries between MCPE enchantment IDs and PocketMine-MP internals are now more clear.
  - ID handling is moved to `pocketmine\data\bedrock\EnchantmentIdMap` singleton.
  - All enchantment ID constants have been removed from `Enchantment`. `pocketmine\data\bedrock\EnchantmentIds` if you still need legacy effect IDs for some reason.
- `Enchantment::RARITY_*` constants were moved to `Rarity` class, and the `RARITY_` prefixes removed.
- `Enchantment::SLOT_*` constants were moved to `ItemFlags` class, and the `SLOT_` prefixes removed.
- The following API methods have been moved:
  - `Enchantment::registerEnchantment()` -> `EnchantmentIdMap->register()`
  - `Enchantment::getEnchantment()` -> `EnchantmentIdMap->fromId()`
  - `Enchantment->getId()` -> `EnchantmentIdMap->toId()`
  - `Enchantment::getEnchantmentByName()` -> `StringToEnchantmentParser->parse()`

### Lang
- The following classes have been renamed:
  - `BaseLang` -> `Language`
  - `TranslationContainer` -> `Translatable`
- The following classes have been removed:
  - `TextContainer`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `Translatable->format()`: allows adding formatting (such as color codes) to a translation
  - `Translatable->prefix()`: allows prefixing formatting
  - `Translatable->postfix()`: allows postfixing formatting
- The following API methods have changed signatures:
  - `Translatable->__construct()` now accepts `array<int|string, Translatable|string>` for parameters, instead of just `list<string>`.
  - `Translatable->getParameter()` now accepts `int|string` for the index instead of just `int`.
  - `Translatable->getParameter()` now returns `Translatable|string` instead of just `string`.
  - `Translatable->getParameters()` now returns `array<int|string, Translatable|string>`.
- `LanguageNotFoundException` has been added. This is thrown when trying to construct a `Language` which doesn't exist in the server files.
- `Translatable` no longer discards keys for translation parameters. Previously, only the insertion order was considered.
- `Translatable` now supports string keys for translation parameters.
- `Translatable` now supports providing other `Translatable`s as translation parameters.
- `Language->translateString()` now supports providing `Translatable`s as translation parameters.
- `Language->translateString()` no longer automatically attempts to translate string parameters. If you want them to be translated, translate them explicitly. This fixes bugs where player chat messages containing translation keys would be unexpectedly translated.
- `Language->translate()` no longer attempts to translate string parameters of `Translatable` (same rationale as previous point).

### Network
- The following fields have been removed:
  - `Network::$BATCH_THRESHOLD`
- The following classes have been added:
  - `NetworkInterfaceStartException`: this may be thrown by `Network->registerInterface()` and `NetworkInterface->start()` to cause a graceful failure without crashing - this should be used when, for example, you are unable to bind a port
- The following classes have been renamed:
  - `SourceInterface` -> `NetworkInterface`
  - `AdvancedSourceInterface` -> `AdvancedNetworkInterface`
- The following classes have been moved:
  - `CompressBatchedTask` -> `mcpe\CompressBatchTask`
  - `level\format\io\ChunkRequestTask` -> `mcpe\ChunkRequestTask`
  - `mcpe\RakLibInterface` -> `mcpe\raklib\RakLibInterface`

  - `mcpe\PlayerNetworkSessionAdapter`
- The following methods have been renamed:
  - `UPnP::PortForward()` -> `UPnP::portForward()`
  - `UPnP::RemovePortForward()` -> `UPnP::removePortForward()`
- The following methods have changed signatures:
  - `UPnP::portForward()` now accepts `string $serviceURL, string $internalIP, int $internalPort, int $externalPort`.
  - `UPnP::removePortForward()` now accepts `string $serviceURL, int $externalPort`.
- The following methods have been removed:
  - `NetworkInterface->putPacket()`
  - `NetworkInterface->close()`
  - `NetworkInterface->emergencyShutdown()`
- `NetworkInterface` now represents a more generic interface to be implemented by any network component, as opposed to specifically a player network interface.
- Everything under the `rcon` subnamespace has been removed.
- `upnp\UPnP` has significant changes. It's now a network component instead of a pair of static methods.

### Permission
- The following new permission nodes have been introduced:
  - `pocketmine.group.everyone`: granted to everyone by default
  - `pocketmine.group.operator`: granted to operator players and the console
  These permission nodes can be assigned and overridden by permission attachments just like any other, which means it's now possible to grant **temporary operator** status which goes away when the player disconnects (or the attachment is removed).
- Permissions are now always false if they haven't been set explictly, or granted implicitly by another permission.
- Undefined permissions are now always `false` instead of following the value of `Permission::$DEFAULT_PERMISSION`.
- Permissions internally no longer have default values. Instead, they are now assigned as a child of one of the `pocketmine.group` permissions:
  - `true`: add as child to `pocketmine.group.everyone` with value `true`
  - `false`: do not add to any permission
  - `op`: add as child to `pocketmine.group.operator` with value `true`
  - `notop`: add as child to `pocketmine.group.everyone` with value `true`, and to `pocketmine.group.operator` with value `false`
  However, the `default` key in `plugin.yml` permission definitions continues to be supported.
- Added `PermissibleDelegateTrait` to reduce boilerplate for users of `PermissibleBase`. This trait is used by `ConsoleCommandSender` and `Player`.
- The following API methods have been moved:
  - `Permission::getByName()` -> `PermissionParser::defaultFromString()`
  - `Permission::loadPermissions()` -> `PermissionParser::loadPermissions()`
  - `Permission::loadPermission()` -> `PermissionParser::loadPermission()`
- The following constants have been moved:
  - `Permission::DEFAULT_FALSE` -> `PermissionParser::DEFAULT_FALSE`
  - `Permission::DEFAULT_TRUE` -> `PermissionParser::DEFAULT_TRUE`
  - `Permission::DEFAULT_OP` -> `PermissionParser::DEFAULT_OP`
  - `Permission::DEFAULT_NOT_OP` -> `PermissionParser::DEFAULT_NOT_OP`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `Permission->addChild()`
  - `Permission->removeChild()`
  - `Permissible->getPermissionRecalculationCallbacks()` - allows reacting to changes of permissions, such as new permissions being granted or denied
  - `Permissible->setBasePermission()` - used for assigning root permissions like `pocketmine.group.operator`; plugins usually shouldn't use this
  - `Permissible->unsetBasePermission()`
  - `PermissionAttachmentInfo->getGroupPermissionInfo()` - returns the `PermissionAttachmentInfo` of the permission that caused the current permission value to be set, or null if the permission is explicit
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `Permissible->isOp()`: use `Permissible->hasPermission(DefaultPermissions::ROOT_OPERATOR)` instead, **but you really shouldn't directly depend on a player's op status, add your own permissions instead!**
  - `Permissible->setOp()`: use `addAttachment($plugin, DefaultPermissions::ROOT_OPERATOR, true)` instead to add, and `removeAttachment()` to remove it (or addAttachment() with false to explicitly deny it, just like any other permission)
  - `Permission->addParent()`
  - `Permission->getDefault()`
  - `Permission->setDefault()`
  - `PermissionManager->getDefaultPermissions()`
  - `PermissionManager->recalculatePermissionDefaults()`
  - `PermissionManager->subscribeToDefaultPerms()`
  - `PermissionManager->unsubscribeFromDefaultPerms()`
  - `PermissionManager->getDefaultPermSubscriptions()`
  - `PermissionAttachment->getPermissible()`
  - `PermissionAttachmentInfo->getPermissible()`
- The following fields have been removed:
  - `Permission::$DEFAULT_PERMISSION`
- The following API methods have changes:
  - `PermissionParser::defaultFromString()` now throws `InvalidArgumentException` on unknown values.
  - `Permission->__construct()` no longer accepts a `$defaultValue` parameter (see notes above about defaults refactor).you should add your permission as a child of `pocketmine.group.everyone` or `pocketmine.group.operator` instead).
- The following classes have been removed:
  - `ServerOperator`

### Player
- The following classes have been added/moved to the new `pocketmine\player` namespace:
  - `Achievement`
  - `GameMode`
  - `IPlayer`
  - `OfflinePlayer`
  - `PlayerInfo`
  - `Player`
  - `SurvivalBlockBreakHandler`: handles cracking animation, sounds and particles when mining a block in creative
  - `UsedChunkStatus`: enum used internally by the chunk sending system
- The following constants have been removed:
  - `Player::SURVIVAL` - use `GameMode::SURVIVAL()`

  - `Player::ADVENTURE` - use `GameMode::ADVENTURE()`
  - `Player::SPECTATOR` - use `GameMode::SPECTATOR()`
  - `Player::VIEW` - use `GameMode::SPECTATOR()`
- (almost) all packet handlers have been removed from `Player`. They are now encapsulated within the network layer.
- `Player->getSpawn()` no longer returns the world's safe spawn if the player's spawn position isn't set. Returning the safe spawn at the time of call made no sense, because it might not have been safe when actually used. You should pass the result of this function to `World->getSafeSpawn()` to get a safe spawn position instead.
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `Player->attackBlock()`: attack (left click) the target block, e.g. to start destroying it (survival)
  - `Player->attackEntity()`: melee-attack (left click) the target entity (if within range)
  - `Player->breakBlock()`: destroy the target block in the current world (immediately)
  - `Player->consumeHeldItem()`: consume the previously activated item, e.g. eating food
  - `Player->continueBreakBlock()`: punch the target block during destruction in survival, advancing break animation and creating particles
  - `Player->getCurrentWindow()`: returns the inventory window the player is currently viewing, or null if they aren't viewing an inventory
  - `Player->getItemCooldownExpiry()`: returns the tick on which the player's cooldown for a given item expires
  - `Player->getLowerCaseName()`: use `strtolower(Player->getName())` instead
  - `Player->getPlayerInfo()`: returns a `PlayerInfo` object containing various metadata about the player
  - `Player->getSaveData()`: returns save data generated on the fly
  - `Player->hasFiniteResources()`
  - `Player->interactBlock()`: interact (right click) the target block in the current world

  - `Player->useHeldItem()`: activate the held item, e.g. throwing a snowball
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `IPlayer->isBanned()`: this was unreliable because it only checked name bans and didn't account for plugin custom ban systems. Use `Server->getNameBans()->isBanned()` and `Server->getIPBans()->isBanned()` instead.
  - `IPlayer->isOp()`: use `Server` APIs instead
  - `IPlayer->isWhitelisted()`: use `Server->isWhitelisted()` instead
  - `IPlayer->setBanned()`: use `Server` APIs instead
  - `IPlayer->setOp()`: use `Server` APIs instead

### Plugin
- API version checks are now more strict. It is no longer legal to declare multiple minimum versions on the same major version. Doing so will now cause the plugin to fail to load with the message `Multiple minimum API versions found for some major versions`.
- `plugin.yml` YAML commands loading is now internalized inside `PluginBase`.
- `PluginManager->registerEvent()` now has a simpler signature: `registerEvent(string $event, \Closure $handler, int $priority, Plugin $plugin, bool $handleCancelled = false)`. The provided closure must accept the specified event class as its only parameter. See [Event API changes](#event) for more details.
- The following classes have been added:
  - `PluginOwned`
- The following classes have been removed:
  - `PluginLogger`
- The following constants have been removed:
  - `PluginLoadOrder::STARTUP` - use `PluginEnableOrder::STARTUP()` 
  - `PluginLoadOrder::POSTWORLD` - use `PluginEnableOrder::POSTWORLD()`
- The following interface requirements have been removed:
  - `Plugin->onEnable()`: this is now internalized inside `PluginBase`
  - `Plugin->onDisable()`: same as above
  - `Plugin->onLoad()`: same as above
  - `Plugin->getServer()` is no longer required to be implemented. It's implemented in `PluginBase` for convenience.
  - `Plugin->isDisabled()` was removed (use `Plugin->isEnabled()` instead).
  - `Plugin` no longer extends `CommandExecutor`. This means that `Plugin` implementations don't need to implement `onCommand()` anymore.
- The following hook methods have changed visibility:
  - `PluginBase->onEnable()` changed from `public` to `protected`
  - `PluginBase->onDisable()` changed from `public` to `protected`
  - `PluginBase->onLoad()` changed from `public` to `protected`
- The following hook methods have been renamed:
  - `Plugin->setEnabled()` -> `Plugin->onEnableStateChange()`. This change was made to force plugin developers misusing this hook to stop, and to give it a name that better describes what it does.
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `PluginManager->addPermission()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->callEvent()`: use `Event->call()` instead
  - `PluginManager->getDefaultPermSubscriptions()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->getDefaultPermissions()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->getPermission()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->getPermissionSubscriptions()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->getPermissions()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->loadPlugin()`: use `PluginManager->loadPlugins()` instead
  - `PluginManager->recalculatePermissionDefaults()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->removePermission()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->subscribeToDefaultPerms()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->subscribeToPermission()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->unsubscribeFromDefaultPerms()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
  - `PluginManager->unsubscribeFromPermission()`: use `PermissionManager` instead
- The following API methods have changed behaviour:
  - `PluginManager->loadPlugins()` now accepts paths to files as well as directories, in which case it will load only the plugin found in the target file.
- It is no longer permitted to throw exceptions from `PluginBase->onEnable()` or `PluginBase->onLoad()`. Doing so will now cause the server to crash.

### Promise
A very basic in-house implementation of Promises has been added. This is currently used for handling world generation requests.

- `PromiseResolver` is created by the creator of the task. The task should call `PromiseResolver->resolve()` when the result is ready.
- `Promise` can be obtained by using `PromiseResolver->getPromise()` and should be returned to API consumers.

Please note that this was not written with plugins in mind and its API may change in a future version.

### Scheduler
#### Thread-local storage for AsyncTasks
- TLS has been completely rewritten in this release to be self contained, more robust and easier to use.
- Now behaves more like simple properties. `storeLocal()` writes, `fetchLocal()` reads.
- Self-contained and doesn't depend on the async pool to clean up after it.
- Values are automatically removed from storage when the `AsyncTask` is garbage-collected, just like a regular property.
- Supports storing multiple values, differentiated by string names.
- `fetchLocal()` can now be used multiple times. It no longer deletes the stored value.
- The following classes have been removed:
  - `FileWriteTask`
- The following methods have been removed:
  - `AsyncTask->peekLocal()`: use `fetchLocal()` instead
- The following methods have signature changes:
  - `AsyncTask->storeLocal()` now has the signature `storeLocal(string $key, mixed $complexData) : void`
  - `AsyncTask->fetchLocal()` now has the signature `fetchLocal(string $key) : mixed`

#### Other AsyncTask changes
- `AsyncPool` uses a new, significantly more performant algorithm for task collection.
- `BulkCurlTask` has had the `$complexData` constructor parameter removed.
- `BulkCurlTask->__construct()` now accepts `BulkCurlTaskOperation[]` instead of `mixed[]`.
- `pocketmine\Collectable` has been removed, and is no longer extended by `AsyncTask`.
- The following hooks have been added:
  - `AsyncTask->onError()`: called on the main thread when an uncontrolled error was detected in the async task, such as a memory failure
- The following hooks have signature changes:
  - `AsyncTask->onCompletion()` no longer accepts a `Server` parameter, and has a `void` return type.
  - `AsyncTask->onProgressUpdate()` no longer accepts a `Server` parameter, and has a `void` return type.
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `AsyncTask->getFromThreadStore()`: use `AsyncTask->worker->getFromThreadStore()`
  - `AsyncTask->removeFromThreadStore()`: use `AsyncTask->worker->removeFromThreadStore()`
  - `AsyncTask->saveToThreadStore()`: use `AsyncTask->worker->saveToThreadStore()`

#### Non-AsyncTask changes
- Added `CancelTaskException`, which can be thrown from `Task->onRun()` to cancel a task (especially useful for `ClosureTask`).
- The `$currentTick` parameter of `Task->onRun()` has been removed (use `Server->getTick()` instead if needed).
- Callables given to `ClosureTask` are no longer required to declare a `void` typehint (useful for arrow functions).

### Server
- New chat broadcasting APIs have been implemented, which don't depend on the permission system.
  - The following API methods have been added:
    - `Server->subscribeToBroadcastChannel()` - allows subscribing a `CommandSender` to receive chat messages (and other message types) on any channel
    - `Server->unsubscribeFromBroadcastChannel()`
    - `Server->unsubscribeFromAllBroadcastChannels()`
    - `Server->getBroadcastChannelSubscribers()`
  - Giving `Player` any `pocketmine.broadcast.*` permissions will cause them to automatically subscribe to the corresponding broadcast channel (and removing them will unsubscribe it).
  - It's now possible to create and subscribe to custom broadcast channels without using permissions.
  - However, `Player`s may automatically unsubscribe themselves from the builtin broadcast channels if they don't have the proper permissions.
  - Automatic subscribe/unsubscribe from custom broadcast channels can be implemented using the new `Permissible` permission recalculation callbacks API.
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `Server->getIpV6()`
  - `Server->getPortV6()`
- The following API methods have been removed:

  - `Server->getGamemodeName()` - replaced by `pocketmine\player\GameMode->name()`
  - `Server->getGamemodeFromString()` - replaced by `GameMode::fromString()`
  - `Server->broadcast()` - use `Server->broadcastMessage()` instead
- The following API methods have changed:
  - `Server->getOfflinePlayerData()` no longer creates data when it doesn't exist.
- The following API methods have been renamed:
  - `Server->getPlayer()` -> `Server->getPlayerByPrefix()` (consider using `Server->getPlayerExact()` instead where possible)

  - `GeneratorManager`
  - `WorldProviderManager`
- The following classes have been added:
  - `BlockTransaction`: allows creating batch commits of block changes with validation conditions - if any block can't be applied, the whole transaction fails to apply.

  - `ChunkListener`: interface allowing subscribing to events happening on a given chunk
  - `ChunkLockId`: used by `World->lockChunk()` and `World->unlockChunk()`

  - `format\io\FastChunkSerializer`: provides methods to encode a chunk for transmitting to another thread
  - `WorldCreationOptions`: used for passing world generator options to `WorldManager->generateWorld()`
- `ChunkLoader` no longer requires implementing `getX()` and `getZ()`.
- `ChunkLoader` no longer causes chunks to get random updates. If this behaviour is needed, implement `TickingChunkLoader`.
- The following classes have been renamed:

  - `World->setBlockAt()` (accepts int x/y/z instead of Vector3, faster for some use cases)
  - `Chunk->isDirty()` (replacement for `Chunk->hasChanged()`)

  - `World->getChunkTiles()`
  - `World->getFullBlock()`

  - `ChunkManager->setChunk()` (and its notable implementations in `World` and `SimpleChunkManager`) no longer accepts NULL for the `$chunk` parameter.
  - `GeneratorManager->registerGenerator()` now requires a `\Closure $presetValidator` parameter. This is used to check generator options of worlds and configs before attempting to use them.
  - `Position->__construct()` now requires the `$world` parameter (it's no longer optional). 
  - `World->addParticle()` now has the signature `addParticle(Vector3 $pos, Particle $particle, ?Player[] $players = null) : void`

  - `World->unlockChunk()` now returns `bool` instead of `void` (to signal whether unlocking succeded or not).
- The following API methods have been renamed / moved:
  - `World->getChunks()` -> `World->getLoadedChunks()`
  - `World->getCollisionCubes()` -> `World->getCollisionBoxes()`
  - `World->getName()` -> `World->getDisplayName()`
  - `World->populateChunk()` has been split into `World->requestChunkPopulation()` and `World->orderChunkPopulation()`.

  - `World->getChunk()` no longer tries to load chunks from disk. If the chunk is not already in memory, null is returned. (This behaviour now properly matches other `ChunkManager` implementations.)
  - `World->getHighestBlockAt()` now returns `null` instead of `-1` if the target X/Z column contains no blocks.
  - The following methods now throw `WorldException` when targeting ungenerated terrain:

  - `World->loadChunk()` no longer creates an empty chunk when the target chunk doesn't exist on disk.
  - `World->setChunk()` has the following behavioural changes:
    - Now fires `ChunkLoadEvent` and `ChunkListener->onChunkLoaded()` when replacing a chunk that didn't previously exist.
    - Now updates entities in the replaced chunk and its neighbours. This fixes bugs such as paintings not dropping and dropped items floating in midair if the ground was lower than before.
    - Entities are no longer deleted on chunk replacement.
    - Tiles are no longer deleted on chunk replacement, unless one of the following conditions is met:
      - the target block in the new chunk doesn't expect a tile
      - the target block in the new chunk expects a different type of tile (responsibility of the plugin developer to create the new tile)
      - there's already a tile in the target chunk which conflicts with the old one
  - `World->useBreakOn()` now returns `false` when the target position is in an ungenerated or unloaded chunk (or chunk locked for generation).
  - `World->useItemOn()` now returns `false` when the target position is in an ungenerated or unloaded chunk (or chunk locked for generation).

### Utils
- The `Color` class was removed. It's now found as `pocketmine\color\Color` in the [`pocketmine/color`](https://github.com/pmmp/Color) package.
- The `UUID` class was removed. [`ramsey/uuid`](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid) version 4.1 is now used instead.
  - `UUID::fromData()` can be replaced by `Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid::uuid3()`
  - `UUID::fromRandom()` can be replaced by `Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid::uuid4()`
  - `UUID::fromBinary()` can be replaced by `Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid::fromBytes()` (use `Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid::isValid()` to check validity)
  - `UUID::toBinary()` is replaced by `Ramsey\Uuid\UuidInterface::getBytes()`
  - See the [documentation for `ramsey/uuid`](https://uuid.ramsey.dev/en/latest/introduction.html) for more information.
- `Terminal::hasFormattingCodes()` no longer auto-detects the availability of formatting codes. Instead it's necessary to use `Terminal::init()` with no parameters to initialize, or `true` or `false` to override.
- `Config->save()` no longer catches exceptions thrown during emitting to disk.
- The following new classes have been added:
  - `InternetException`
  - `Internet`
  - `Process`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `Config->getPath()`: returns the path to the config on disk
  - `Config::parseList()`: parses a list of entries like `ops.txt` into an array
  - `Config::parseProperties()`: parses a properties file like `server.properties` into an array
  - `Config::writeList()`
  - `Config::writeProperties()`
  - `Terminal::write()`: emits a Minecraft-formatted text line without newline
  - `Terminal::writeLine()`: emits a Minecraft-formatted text line with newline
  - `Utils::recursiveUnlink()`: recursively deletes a directory and its contents
- The following API class constants have been added:
  - `TextFormat::COLORS`: lists all known color codes
  - `TextFormat::FORMATS`: lists all known formatting codes (e.g. italic, bold). (`RESET` is not included because it _removes_ formats, rather than adding them.)
- The following deprecated API redirects have been removed:
  - `Utils::execute()`: moved to `Process`
  - `Utils::getIP()`: moved to `Internet`
  - `Utils::getMemoryUsage()`: moved to `Process`
  - `Utils::getRealMemoryUsage()`: moved to `Process`
  - `Utils::getThreadCount()`: moved to `Process`
  - `Utils::getURL()`: moved to `Internet`
  - `Utils::kill()`: moved to `Process`

- The following API fields have been removed / hidden:
  - `Utils::$ip`
  - `Utils::$online`
  - `Utils::$os`
- The following API methods have signature changes:
  - `Internet::simpleCurl()` now requires a `Closure` for its `onSuccess` parameter instead of `callable`.
  - `Process::kill()` now requires an additional `bool $subprocesses` parameter.
- The following API methods have behavioural changes:
  - `Utils::parseDocComment()` now allows `-` in tag names.
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `TextFormat::toJSON()`
  - `Utils::getCallableIdentifier()`
- `MainLogger` now pushes log messages to `server.log` before calling logger attachments. This fixes messages not being written to disk when an uncaught error is thrown from a logger attachment.

## Gameplay
### World loading
- Chunks are now sent in proper circles. This improves the experience when flying quickly parallel to X or Z axis, since now more chunks in front of the player will load sooner.
- Many bugs in player respawning have been fixed, including:
  - Spawning underneath bedrock when spawn position referred to ungenerated terrain
  - Spawning underneath bedrock on first server join on very slow machines (or when the machine was under very high load)
  - Spawning inside blocks (or above the ground) when respawning with a custom spawn position set
  - Player spawn positions sticking to the old location when world spawn position changed - this was because the world spawn at time of player creation was used as the player's custom spawn, so the bug will persist for older player data, but will work as expected for new players.

### Blocks

  - bamboo
  - bamboo sapling
  - barrel

    - granite (smooth and natural)
    - mossy cobblestone
    - prismarine (natural, dark and bricks)
    - red nether brick
    - red sandstone (and variants)
  - stone-like slabs of many variants
- Non-player entities now bounce when falling on beds.
- Players and mobs now receive reduced fall damage when falling on beds.
- Fixed cake block desync when attempting to eat in creative (eating in creative is not yet supported, but the block rollback was missing).
- Fixed the bounding box of skulls when mounted on a wall.
- Fixed podzol dropping itself when mined (instead of dirt).

### Items
- Implemented the following items:
  - records
  - compounds (from Minecraft: Education Edition)
  - black, brown, blue and white dyes
- Compasses now point to the correct (current) world's spawn point after teleporting players to a different world. Previously, they would continue to point to the spawn of the world that the player initially spawned in.

### Inventory
- Implemented offhand inventory.
- Block-picking is now supported in survival mode.
- Block picking behaviour now matches vanilla (no longer overwrites held item, jumps to existing item where possible).
- Armor can now be equipped by right-clicking while holding it.
- Picking up some items from a dropped stack of items is now supported. This fixes various bugs with being unable to pick up items with an almost-full inventory.
- Fixed arrows getting added to creative players' inventories when picked up.

### Misc
- Added support for emotes.

# 4.0.1
Released 9th December 2021.

## General
- Added a script `tools/ping-server.php`. This was sitting in my workspace for many years.
- `Minecraft network interface running` messages are no longer shown if RakLib was prevented from starting.

## Fixes
### Core
- Fixed server crash when `FallingBlock` has invalid block data that it can't understand.
- Fixed server crash when loading chunks containing tiles outside the world bounds.
- Fixed server crash when loading LevelDB chunks containing blockstates which are invalid or not yet supported - they are now treated as corrupted instead.
- Fixed `level.dat` becoming corrupted by world saves when the disk is full - now it will still fail to save, but it will leave the original data intact. Previously it would destroy the data and leave behind an empty file.
- Fixed configs becoming corrupted when saved when the disk is full - now they'll still fail to save, but the original file will remain intact.

### API
- Fixed mistakes in the 4.0.0 changelog:
  - Removal of `Player->getLowerCaseName()` is now mentioned.
  - `CreativeInventory::reset()` is the successor to `Item::initCreativeItems()`, not `CreativeInventory::init()`.
  - Note that the changelog when viewing from the 4.0.0 GitHub release will remain the same; only the changelog in the current repo will be different.
- `Config->save()` will no longer write empty data to the file when using JSON and the data fails to encode - an exception will be thrown instead.
- `StringToItemParser` now returns the correct items for `bamboo`, `shulker_box`, `stone_slab`, `stone_stairs` and `tall_grass`.
- `StringToItemParser` now recognizes `slime` and `slime_block` (these were previously missing).

# 4.0.2
Released 12th December 2021.

## Fixes
### Core
- Fixed server crash when loading written books containing pages with invalid UTF-8 characters - the invalid characters are now scrubbed.
- Fixed server crash when root type of `plugin.yml` is valid, but not an array.
- Fixed ConsoleReader crash due OPcache ASLR issue - it's not clear what caused this, but OPcache is not needed in the subprocess anyway.
- Fixed backslashes getting stripped from unquoted command arguments - these were only supposed to be stripped from quoted arguments, to allow escaping of quotes.
- `build/generate-known-translation-apis.php` now sorts numerically-indexed arguments into ascending order, irrespective of the order they appear in the original string.

### API
- `KnownTranslationKeys` and `KnownTranslationFactory` are now marked `@internal`.
- `ItemEntity` now clones the itemstack passed to its constructor, fixing various confusing mutability issues.
- `PlayerExperienceChangeEvent->setNewProgress()` now performs range checks. This fixes the root of a very old and confusing crash bug which took several years to identify the cause of.
  - Note that the defective plugin(s) which caused this problem will still cause a server crash, but the plugin responsible will now get blamed correctly.
- `GeneratorManager->addGenerator()` now consistently converts the given alias to lowercase. Due to a bug, it previously didn't do this if the `$overwrite` parameter was set to `true`, causing a range of confusing bugs.

# 4.0.3
Released 16th December 2021.

## Fixes
- Fixed `/dumpmemory` crashing when encountering uninitialized typed properties.
- Fixed all chunks containing furnaces being treated as corrupted in worlds older than 2017.
  - This was caused by a strict corruption check detecting bad data created by a bug in PocketMine-MP that was fixed in 2017.
- Fixed player arm swing animation not being shown when attacks were cancelled by attack cooldown.
- Fixed being unable to use `/deop` to de-op a player whose name appeared in `ops.txt` with uppercase letters in it.
- Added a check for valid tile class in `BlockIdentifier`.

- Fixed incorrect message being displayed when trying to sleep in a bed which is too far away.
- Fixed missing space between `Kicked by admin.` and `Reason` when using `/kick` to kick a player.
- Fixed client-side performance issue of entities with very large scale.

# 4.0.5
Released 4th January 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed several denial-of-service attack vectors related to writable book text length and encoding.
- Fixed several denial-of-service attack vectors related to skin data field lengths.
- Fixed food bar desync when cancelling `PlayerItemConsumeEvent` in a plugin.
- Fixed compass needles not updating when the world spawn is changed.

- Fixed ender pearls teleporting players when thrown by a player directly against a wall when cancelling `ProjectileLaunchEvent`.
- Fixed collision box of brewing stand.
- Fixed break times and tool types of bamboo, nether wart blocks, infested stone and leaves.

# 4.0.8
Released 25th January 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed ender chest not dropping itself when mined with a Silk Touch pickaxe.
- The correct amount of fall damage is now taken when falling from a height onto hay bales.

# 4.0.9
Released 5th February 2022.

## Fixes
### Core
- The spawn chunk of the default world is no longer loaded during shutdown. Previously, it would attempt to find a safe spawn to teleport players to, only to unload the target world of that safe spawn and not use it.
- The spawn chunk of the default world is no longer loaded when unloading a non-default world containing zero players.
- Fixed chunk version `8` in Bedrock worlds being treated as corrupted. These appeared in worlds between 1.2.13 and 1.8.0.

### API
- Added missing bounds check to `Liquid->setDecay()`.
- Fixed `StringToItemParser` returning concrete instead of concrete powder when given `<color>_concrete_powder`.

### Gameplay
- Cobwebs now drop themselves when broken using shears.
- Fixed spectator players being able to drop items.
- Fixed collision shapes of Bell in different orientations.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.18.0**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 4.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 4.1.0
Released 7th February 2022.

## General
- Game mode names (e.g. `survival`, `creative`) may now be used for the `gamemode` property in `server.properties`.
- Increased default maximum render distance to 16 chunks. Players with a render distance smaller than this will notice no difference.
- The setup wizard now prompts for a maximum render distance value.
- The setup wizard now prompts for an IPv6 port selection. Previously it would always use 19133.
- `chunk-ticking.disable-block-ticking` now accepts block names like those used in the `/give` command.
- The `/clear` command now behaves more like vanilla:
  - The order of inventories is now the same as Bedrock.
  - The cursor and offhand inventories are now cleared if necessary.

## Technical
- `PlayerAuthInputPacket` is now used instead of `MovePlayerPacket` for processing movements. This improves position and rotation accuracy.
- `&&` and `||` are now always used instead of `and` and `or`.
- New version of `pocketmine/errorhandler` is used by this version, adding support for `ErrorToExceptionHandler::trap()`. This enables reliably capturing `E_WARNING` and `E_NOTICE` from functions such as `yaml_parse()` and friends.
- New dependency versions are required by this version:
  - `pocketmine/bedrock-protocol` has been updated from 7.1.0 to [7.3.0](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockProtocol/releases/tag/7.3.0%2Bbedrock-1.18.0).

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 4.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 4.2.0
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.18.10.

# 4.2.1
Released 19th February 2022.

## General
- Improved performance of `Item::nbtSerialize()` - this will improve performance during world saves.
- Added more missing changes to the 4.0.0 changelog.

## Fixes
- Fixed multiple players being able to sleep in the same bed.
- Fixed hitbox not resetting properly after swimming or gliding.

# 4.2.2
Released 2nd March 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed crash in `/dumpmemory` due to usage of non-printable string keys in `CraftingManager`. Array contents in memory dumps are now rendered as prettified key-value pairs.
- Fixed output directory for `/dumpmemory`.
- `PlayerInventory->isHotbarSlot()` now correctly returns `false` when given `9`.
- Fixed ghost items left in the inventory when dropping tools while mining.

# 4.2.3
Released 9th March 2022.

## Technical
- Now analysed using PHPStan 1.4.8.
- Now using `pocketmine/bedrock-protocol` [`8.0.1`](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockProtocol/releases/tag/8.0.1%2Bbedrock-1.18.10).

## Fixes
### Core
- Fixed a memory leak and other bugs related to plugins disabling themselves during `onEnable()`.

### Gameplay
- Sweet berry bushes now absorb fall damage.
- Fixed mycelium spreading onto coarse dirt.
- Fixed blocks placed during `Block->onIncinerate()` getting overwritten.
- Fixed shulker boxes being unopenable when underwater.
- Fixed invisible fire on top of transparent non-flammable blocks.

### API
- Various APIs accepting `Vector3`, `Position` or `Location` no longer accept objects containing `INF` or `NaN` in any component. Previously, this was allowed, but would cause lots of obscure crashes later on.
- `Entity->setRotation()` no longer accepts `INF` or `NaN`.
- Fixed missing bounds check for `ItemFrame->setItemDropChance()`.

# 4.2.4
Released 18th March 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed a crash when handling out-of-bounds meta values on the network.

# 4.2.5
Released 28th March 2022.

## General
- The layout of the human-readable part of crashdumps has been changed in an effort to improve the useful information density. It is hoped that this change will cause more useful information to be provided when people paste crash traces on Discord, since all the most important information is now at the top of the file.
  - Version, git hash, PHP version and OS have been moved to the top of the crashdump.
  - Backtrace has been moved above code sample.
- Docker images are now built by GitHub Actions (first live test).

## Technical
- The methods of `Inventory` and `BaseInventory` have been rearranged to improve coherency.

## Fixes
### API
- Enum members of enums created using `EnumTrait` are now able to have single-character names.
- Registry members of registries created using `RegistryTrait` or `CloningRegistryTrait` now have their names checked for invalid characters.
- `Entity::__construct()` now uses a guard variable to prevent it from being called multiple times unintentionally. This is necessary because `Entity::__construct()` has side effects.
- Fixed `PlayerItemHeldEvent` not being called when the content of the held slot was changed (e.g. replacing the held item via inventory menu).

### Gameplay
- Reduced the appearance of ghost items in unsupported gameplay scenarios using client prediction information. This fixes, for example, the appearance of ghost items when right-clicking on a filled flower pot.

# 4.2.6
Released 1st April 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed buffer length underflow crash in `LoginPacket` handling.

# 4.2.7
Released 15th April 2022.

## General
- Added lots more documentation (in comments) about the `aliases` section in `pocketmine.yml`. You can read about this feature in the `aliases` section of the [updated `pocketmine.yml` template](/resources/pocketmine.yml).

- Fixed buggy movement when teleporting the player during `PlayerToggleSneakEvent`, `PlayerToggleSprintEvent`, `PlayerToggleSwimEvent` and `PlayerToggleGlideEvent`.

# 4.2.8
Released 17th April 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed a memory leak in RakLib which could result in a server crash when players stay online for a long time.
- Fixed server crash when attempting to load a corrupted empty resource pack.

Released 19th April 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed several potential crashes when deserializing item NBT (due to insufficient validation of input data).

# 4.2.10
Released 20th April 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed performance issue when chat messages received from the client contain many newlines. This security vulnerability was disclosed publicly necessitating a priority fix.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.18.30**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 4.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 4.3.0
Released 20th April 2022.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.18.30.
- Removed support for older versions.

# 4.3.1
Released 23rd April 2022.

- Removed useless doc comment in `PlayerChangeSkinEvent`.

# 4.3.3
Released 16th May 2022.

## General
- Improved display of parameters in exception stack trace logs.
- Exception stack traces now include names for dynamic named arguments (i.e. arguments that don't match any parameter of the function), if any were given.
  - Note: Named arguments which do match parameters are not shown this way, since PHP reduces them to positional arguments for performance reasons.

## Fixes
- Fixed server crash when chunks are unloaded during chunk generation callbacks
- Fixed dead coral fan items placing coral fans in the wrong orientation.
- Fixed max stack size of boat items.

# 4.3.4
Released 22nd May 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed `difficulty` in `server.properties` having no effect - it's now applied to newly generated worlds.
  - Note: this setting still doesn't behave the same way as vanilla due to potential disruption to existing servers.
- Fixed paintings not working in newly generated worlds and some other cases.
- Fixed inventory window switching breaking the inventory UI in some cases (e.g. pressing E while clicking a chest).
- Fixed minecart items incorrectly stacking.
- Fixed incorrect light levels in translucent blocks at the top of the world.
- Fixed teleporting sleeping players causing broken behaviour on the sleeping player's client.
- Fixed `EntityExplodeEvent->setYield()` accepting values outside the range 0-100.

  - `PlayerDropItemEvent`
  - `PlayerItemHeldEvent`
  - `PlayerKickEvent`
  - `PlayerQuitEvent`
  - `PlayerTransferEvent`
  - `UpdateNotifyEvent`

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.18.30**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 4.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 4.4.0
Released 1st June 2022.

## General
- The server will now shut itself down if any of the following errors occur during startup:
  - Any plugin fails to load or enable (plugins loaded by other plugins post-startup are **not** affected by this change) (**PR [#4951](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4951)**)
    - The motivation for this change is to prevent situations where plugins failing to load could result in adverse outcomes, such as a world protection plugin leaving a lobby unprotected from griefing.
    - If you encounter this problem, remove the offending plugin(s) or prevent it from loading using `plugin_list.yml`.
    - See **PR [#4951](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4951)** for more detail on this change.
  - Any world mentioned in `server.properties` or `pocketmine.yml` fails to load (worlds loaded by plugins are **not** affected by this change)
  - Any world mentioned in `server.properties` or `pocketmine.yml` fails to generate (e.g. due to invalid generator settings)
- Enabling the server whitelist while the server is running (e.g. using `/whitelist on`) will now kick any non-whitelisted players currently on the server (**PR [#4774](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4774)**).
- Help for commands (`/help <name of command>`) now displays a list of aliases of that command.
- A CRITICAL log message is now generated if a plugin disables itself when enabling, in case the plugin doesn't emit any error of its own.
- The `/give` command now shows the alias used to find the given item in the success message, instead of the item ID/meta.

## Fixes
- Block placement has been fixed in many places where it previously didn't work correctly (**PR [#4886](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4886)**):
  - torches on top of slabs, upside-down stairs
  - torches on the back face of stairs
  - flower pots on top of fences
  - the list goes on and on ...
- Fixed backslash escapes not getting properly removed from commands in some cases.
- Fixed aliases defined in the `aliases` section of `pocketmine.yml` not being treated as quote-aware.

## Gameplay
- Plants in flower pots can now be removed by right-clicking on the flower pot.
- Leaves now have a 2% chance of dropping sticks when destroyed by hand (**PR [#5019](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/5019)**).
- Food exhaustion now matches Bedrock 1.18.30 (**PR [#5034](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/5034)**).
- Implemented Stonecutter block (**PR [#4732](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4732)**).

## API
### Block
- Added `Block->getSupportType(Facing) : SupportType` (**PR [#4886](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4886)**).
  - This is used to determine the kind of support a block face can provide to a block (e.g. a torch) placed on it.
- Added `utils\SupportType` enum (**PR [#4886](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4886)**).
- `tile\Spawnable->isDirty()` and `tile\Spawnable->setDirty()` are now `@deprecated`.

### Command
- Added `CommandStringHelper::parseQuoteAware()`. This static method contains the code used by `SimpleCommandMap` used to parse quoted command arguments.

### Entity
- Added `Human::emote()` (**PR [#4610](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4610)**)

### Event
- `PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent` is now `@deprecated`, since its functionality is entirely replaced by other, general-purpose events.
  - Use `CommandEvent` to intercept commands.
  - Use `PlayerChatEvent` to intercept chat messages.
  - To convert a chat message into a command, pass it directly to `Server->dispatchCommand()` with the player as sender.
- Added `PlayerPostChunkSendEvent` (**PR [#4937](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4937)**).
- Added `PlayerDeathEvent->setKeepXp()` (**PR [#4015](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4015)**).
- `InventoryCloseEvent` is now called **after** the target window has been removed. This fixes various feedback loops caused by trying to open new windows to a player while there was one still active.
  - As a side effect, this now means that `Player->getCurrentWindow()` will return `null` during `InventoryCloseEvent`. Use `InventoryCloseEvent->getInventory()` instead.

### Item
- `StringToItemParser` now recognizes `cod`, `raw_cod` and `cooked_cod` aliases.

### Plugin
- `DisablePluginException` may now be thrown from `Plugin::onEnable()` to make the server gracefully disable the plugin (without crashing) (**PR [#4780](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pull/4780)**).
- `PluginManager->registerEvent()` now returns the `RegisteredListener` created for the handler, to permit unregistering it later.

## Internals
- Private property declarations now use typed properties (PHP 7.4) and promoted constructor properties (PHP 8.0) wherever possible.
  - Protected and public properties remain unchanged, since they can't be changed without breaking subclasses.
- Promoted constructor properties are only used when it's consistently possible to promote most or all properties in a class.
- Simplified and improved legibility of `FormattedCommandAlias`.
- Added unit tests for the quote-aware command parser used by `SimpleCommandMap`.
- Various hardcoded values in `block` package classes have been moved to private constants to improve readability.
- Added various constants used in the `LevelDB` world provider.

## Internals
- Added more detailed debug logging during the player login sequence.
- Silenced debug spam during `PreSpawnPacketHandler`, considerably reducing debug noise when players join.
- Fixed an edge case in `InventoryManager->removeWindow()`. This bug didn't have any effect on stable versions, but caused a `next-minor` development version to crash.
- `Item`s returned by event getters are now cloned if modifying the result will have no useful side effects.
- Updated `pocketmine/bedrock-data` to [`1.11.1`](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockData/tree/1.11.1%2Bbedrock-1.19.30), which reduces bandwidth consumption during logins by not sending useless biome generation data.

- Fixed splash potions affecting players in spectator mode.
- Fixed `World->addParticle()` sending particles to players who couldn't possibly see them when a list of targets was used.
- Fixed `World->addSound()` sending sounds to players who couldn't possibly hear them when a list of targets was used.

## Documentation
- Improved type information available for various API methods in `World`.

# 4.10.1
Released 7th November 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed spawning in the void if spawn terrain in a world is solid at the default spawn position.
- Fixed totems of undying activating when the player has 1 HP remaining.
- Fixed durable items such as tools becoming unbreakable when in stacks larger than 1. Now, the durability correctly resets when the tool breaks.
- TPS below 12 now correctly shows as red in `/status`. Previously, it showed as orange due to a condition ordering bug.
- Improved handling of missing arguments in user-defined `pocketmine.yml` command aliases. Previously, missing arguments would be filled with an empty string, which caused a variety of unexpected behaviour.

## Internals
- Added validation for the array given to `BaseInventory->setContents()` to ensure that it contains only `Item` instances.
- Silenced `PlayerAuthInputPacket` spam when the session is in the "spawn response" state.
- Updated to PHPStan 1.9.

# 4.10.2
Released 25th November 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed crashes on macOS and Linux when using console colours without the `TERM` environment variable set.
- Fixed crashdumps not being generated when error messages contained invalid UTF-8 characters.

## Documentation
- Clarified documentation of caching behaviour for `Internet::getIP()`.
- Added and improved documentation for many `Inventory` methods.
- Rewritten documentation for `PlayerCreationEvent` with warnings and more detail.

## Internals
- Non-arrow projectile damage is now unscaled. Scaling according to velocity is only applied to arrows. This currently doesn't cause any observable change in behaviour, but is required for future additions.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.40**

This is a minor feature release for PocketMine-MP, introducing some new features and improvements.

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 4.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 4.11.0
Released 25th November 2022.

## General
- Packet receive timings have now been split into two subcategories - Decode and Handle.
- Console command entry can now be disabled via the `console.enable-input` setting in `pocketmine.yml`.
  - Best suited for headless servers (e.g. in a Docker container) where the console will never be used anyway.
  - Disabling the console reader slightly reduces memory usage, because console reading currently requires an additional subprocess.
- Console command output now appears on the terminal only, and is not written to the log file.
- The output from console commands now appears with a `Command output |` prefix, instead of as a log message.
- User-defined `pocketmine.yml` custom commands now use a generic description which makes clear the command is config-defined.
- Introduced validation for the `--data` and `--plugins` command line options.
- Encrypted resource packs are now supported, by means of adding a `.key` file alongside the pack in the `resource_packs` folder.
  - e.g. `MyEncryptedPack.zip` -> `MyEncryptedPack.zip.key`
  - The file must contain the raw key bytes, and must not end with a newline.

## Configuration
- The `chunk-ticking.per-tick` setting is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.
  - The functionality of this setting has been removed, since it caused more problems than it solved.
  - Setting it to zero will still disable chunk ticking (for now), but this should now be done by setting `chunk-ticking.tick-radius` to `0` instead.

## Gameplay
- Fixed supporting blocks of dead bush to be in line with vanilla.
- Sugarcane can now be grown using bonemeal on any part of the sugarcane. Previously, it only worked when used on the bottom block.
- Fixed missing sounds when adding, rotating, or removing items in item frames.
- Fixed modifier values for Instant Damage and Regeneration effects.
- Implemented Darkness effect.
- Improved chunk random ticking:
  - Removed the limit on chunks ticked per tick, and its associated config option is no longer respected.
    - This change significantly improves crop and plant growth with large numbers of players.
    - This limit was causing a linear decrease in chunk ticking speed with larger numbers of players, leading to worsened gameplay experience.
    - **Warning: This change will result in increased CPU usage if players are spread over a very large area.**
  - Every chunk within the configured tick radius of a player will be ticked. Previously, chunks were randomly selected from the radius.

## API
### General
- Plugins are now always disabled before their dependencies, to ensure that they are able to shutdown properly (e.g. a core plugin depending on a database plugin may want to save data to a DB during `onDisable()`).
- [`webmozart/path-util`](https://packagist.org/packages/webmozart/path-util) has been deprecated, and will be dropped in favour of [`symfony/filesystem`](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/filesystem) in PM5.
    - To prepare for this change, simply replace any usage of `Webmozart\PathUtil\Path` with `Symfony\Component\Filesystem\Path`, which is available as a dependency in this release.

### `pocketmine`
- The following API methods are now deprecated:
  - `Server->getPlayerByPrefix()`

### `pocketmine\entity`
- `EntitySpawnEvent` and `ItemSpawnEvent` are now fired on the first tick after the entity is added to the world. Previously, these events were called directly from the entity constructor, making it impossible to get properties like velocity which are often set after the entity is created.
- The following API methods are now deprecated:
  - `Living->hasLineOfSight()`

### `pocketmine\event\block`
- The following new classes have been added:
  - `BlockDeathEvent` - event called when coral or coral blocks die due to lack of water

### `pocketmine\item`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public Armor->clearCustomColor() : $this`

### `pocketmine\inventory\transaction`
- Introduced a `TransactionBuilder` class. This makes it less of a hassle to build an `InventoryTransaction` server-side, since the regular `Inventory` API methods can be used, rather than having to manually create `SlotChangeAction`s.

### `pocketmine\lang`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public Language->getAll() : array<string, string>`

### `pocketmine\player`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public Player->sendToastNotification(string $title, string $body) : void` - makes a grey box appear at the top of the player's screen containing the specified message

### `pocketmine\utils`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public static TextFormat::addBase(string $baseFormat, string $string) : string` - used for coloured log messages, changes the base formatting of a string by inserting the given formatting codes after every RESET code

### `pocketmine\world`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public World->getChunkTickRadius() : int` - returns the world's simulation radius
  - `public World->setChunkTickRadius(int $radius) : void` - sets the world's simulation radius

### `pocketmine\world\sound`
- The following new classes have been added:
  - `ItemFrameAddItemSound`
  - `ItemFrameRemoveItemSound`
  - `ItemFrameRotateItemSound`

## Internals
- Improved performance of `ContainerTrait` dropping items on block destroy. ([link](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commits/24e72ec109c1442b09558df89b6833cf2f2e0ec7))
- Avoid repeated calls to `Position->getWorld()` (use local variables). ([link](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/2940547026db40ce76deb46e992870de3ead79ad))
- Revamped the way `InventoryManager` handles fake inventory slot mappings for stuff like crafting tables. ([link](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/e90abecf38d9c57635fa0497514bba7e546a2469))
  - Inventories are now mapped on a per-slot basis. This means that more than one inventory can be mapped to the same window ID, which is necessary for correctly handling "UI" inventories like crafting tables.
  - `InventoryManager->getWindow(int $windowId) : ?Inventory` is replaced by `locateWindowAndSlot` (see below).
  - Added `InventoryManager->locateWindowAndSlot(int $windowId, int $netSlotId) : array{Inventory, int}` - accepts a window ID and absolute slot ID, and returns the associated inventory and the slot relative to the inventory's own start (for use with `getItem()` etc.).
  - Slot offset mapping for "UI" inventories is now handled in `InventoryManager->createComplexSlotMapping()` instead of in `TypeConverter`.
- Console polling is now done on the main thread (no longer a performance concern). ([link](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/b3f03d7ae645de67a54b7300c09b94eeca16298e))
- Console reader subprocess should now automatically die if the server main process is killed, instead of persisting as a zombie. ([link](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/2585160ca2c4df5758b8b980331307402ff9f0fb))
- `ConsoleCommandSender` is no longer responsible for relaying broadcast messages to `MainLogger`. A new `BroadcastLoggerForwarder` has been added, which is subscribed to the appropriate server broadcast channels in order to relay messages. This ensures that chat messages and command audit messages are logged. ([link](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/83e5b0adb6fa0dddec377182bb1c7945ac8f7820))
- `DelegateInventory` now uses `WeakReference` to track its inventory listener. This allows the delegate to be reused. ([link](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/3feaa18f6c10c3a99c0deca75f57ec2d74b92ab4))
- Non-arrow projectile damage is now unscaled. Scaling according to velocity is only applied to arrows. This currently doesn't cause any observable change in behaviour, but is required for future additions.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.50**

### Note about API versions
Plugins which don't touch the protocol and compatible with any previous 4.x.y version will also run on these releases and do not need API bumps.
Plugin developers should **only** update their required API to this version if you need the changes in this build.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the protocol, you're not shielded by API change constraints.** You should consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you do.

# 4.12.0
Released 30th November 2022.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.50.
- Removed support for older versions.

# 4.12.1
Released 4th December 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed items glitching when dragging a stack of items across the crafting grid (desync issues).

# 4.12.2
Released 15th December 2022.

## Fixes
- Folder used for plugins (optionally specified by `--plugins`) is no longer required to be writable.
- Fixed broken writable check for server data folder (`is_writable()` broken on NFS and similar filesystems).
- `Filesystem::createLockFile()` exceptions now include more information about why the lock file could not be created.
- Fixed client-side item predictions not being rolled back when cancelling events such as `PlayerItemUseEvent`.

## Dependencies
- Updated BedrockProtocol to [17.1.0](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockProtocol/releases/tag/17.1.0+bedrock-1.19.50). This adds some missing `LevelSoundEvent` constants and fixes the values for `ContainerUIIds`.

# 4.12.3
Released 28th December 2022.

## Fixes
- Fixed unauthenticated connections taking up player count slots, preventing players from joining.
- Fixed a possible crash in `World->tickChunk()` when plugins unload chunks during some events.
- `/gamemode` will now report a failure to change game mode if the player is already in the requested game mode.

# 4.12.4
Released 3rd January 2023.

## Fixes
- Added workarounds for an active exploit being used to deny service to servers.

# 4.12.5
Released 6th January 2023.

## Fixes
- Removed a workaround for an old client bug in custom form responses. The code contained a denial-of-service vulnerability.

# 4.12.6
Released 7th January 2023.

## Changes
- Added a new security measure to `NetworkSession` to detect and ban players who flood the server with packets.

# 4.12.7
Released 8th January 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed players getting kicked when the server lags for too long.
- Fixed players getting kicked when a debugging session is active and a breakpoint is hit.

# 4.12.8
Released 9th January 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed players getting kicked during PvP.
- Fixed players randomly getting kicked on Windows (improper rate limit handling wrt. 15ms timer resolution).

# 4.12.9
Released 16th January 2023.

## Improvements
### Timings
- Added new timers:
  - `Server Mid-Tick Processing` - time spent processing Snooze interrupts between ticks (e.g. incoming network packets)
  - `Server Tick Update Cycle` - time spent processing regular per-tick updates (e.g. entity movement, world updates, etc.) (`Server->tick()`)
- `Full Server Tick` timer now counts the total of `Server Mid-Tick Processing` and `Server Tick Update Cycle`, which generates more accurate performance metrics.
  - Previously, this timer only counted the time spent during regular per-tick updates, and the time recorded by `Server Mid-Tick Processing` was not included in the report at all.

## Fixes
- Fixed blocks such as pressure plates being able to be placed without the correct supporting blocks if the clicked block was solid.
- Pressure plates now self-destruct when the block below them is removed.
- Fixed being unable to place blocks by clicking on the side of a bell (when the click doesn't result in ringing the bell).
- Fixed various rotation-aware blocks (e.g. stairs) behaving incorrectly when placed by clicking on the side of a replaceable block (e.g. tall grass).
- Fixed banners being able to be placed on top of blocks such as skulls.
- Fixed server-side collision boxes of walls and glass (which should connect, but didn't). Note that wall connections still don't show client side - this just fixes the collision boxes.
- Fixed `PlayerInteractEvent` with `LEFT_CLICK` sometimes firing before `BlockBreakEvent` when breaking blocks.

## Other changes
- Increased packet batch budget for player sessions.

# 4.12.10
Released 18th January 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed reported server load not including the time spent processing Snooze interrupts between ticks (e.g. incoming network packets).
- Fixed `Connection Handler` entry in timings report not including time spent receiving packets.

## Note about server load & performance
This version will report higher apparent server load than previous versions. The actual performance of the server is unchanged; the previous reported load was inaccurate.
These bugs have been present for nearly 5 years (ever since the first introduction of Snooze in 3.0.0).

# 4.12.11
Released 22nd January 2023.

## General
- Code is now tested and analysed using PHP 8.2 in addition to 8.1 and 8.0.

## Fixes
- Fixed pthreads 5.0.0 incorrectly being treated as compatible.
- Fixed deprecation errors on PHP 8.2.

## Documentation
- Updated documentation in `PlayerPreLoginEvent`.

# 4.13.0
Released 30th January 2023.

## Gameplay
- Death message is now shown on the death screen when a player dies.
- Armour damage is now only increased if the armour reduced the damage taken.
- Implemented Swift Sneak enchantment.
- Fixed incorrect collision box calculation of walls and glass/bars when connected. Note: Client-side, wall connections are still broken; this only fixes projectile flight server-side.

## Performance
- Improved performance of chunk selection for chunk random ticking using a cache. This improves performance of chunk random ticking by 10-20%.

## Localization
- Added localized description for the `/dumpmemory` command.

## Permissions
- Added the following new core permissions:
  - `pocketmine.command.effect.other` - allows the player to use the `/effect` command on other players (default operator only)
  - `pocketmine.command.effect.self` - allows the player to use the `/effect` command on themselves (default operator only)
  - `pocketmine.command.enchant.other` - allows the player to use the `/enchant` command on other players (default operator only)
  - `pocketmine.command.enchant.self` - allows the player to use the `/enchant` command on themselves (default operator only)
  - `pocketmine.command.gamemode.other` - allows the player to use the `/gamemode` command on other players (default operator only)
  - `pocketmine.command.gamemode.self` - allows the player to use the `/gamemode` command on themselves (default operator only)
  - `pocketmine.command.give.other` - allows the player to use the `/give` command on other players (default operator only)
  - `pocketmine.command.give.self` - allows the player to use the `/give` command on themselves (default operator only)

  - `pocketmine.command.teleport.other` - allows the player to use the `/teleport` command on other players (default operator only)
  - `pocketmine.command.teleport.self` - allows the player to use the `/teleport` command on themselves (default operator only)
  - `pocketmine.command.title.other` - allows the player to use the `/title` command on other players (default operator only)
  - `pocketmine.command.title.self` - allows the player to use the `/title` command on themselves (default operator only)

## Internals
- Decoupled `Player->sendMessage()` and `Player->sendTranslation()`.
- Refactored resource pack loading in `ResourcePackManager` to make it easier to understand.
- Client-aware translation processing has been moved to `NetworkSession` due to being client-specific.
- Replaced hardcoded strings with constants in various places.
- `NetworkSession` destructive cleanup is now deferred to the next session tick. This fixes various `InventoryManager` crashes when kicking players during events.
- Updated code using `strpos()` to use `str_starts_with()`, `str_ends_with()` and `str_contains()` where appropriate.
- Added documentation for some internal methods.

## API
### `pocketmine\command`

- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public Item->onInteractEntity(Player $player, Entity $entity, Vector3 $clickVector) : bool` - called when a player interacts with an entity with this item in hand

### `pocketmine\lang`
- `Language->translate()` and `Language->translateString()` no longer parse nested translation in the "base text". This was never intended behaviour, and didn't work beyond the first level anyway.

### `pocketmine\player`
- The following new interfaces have been added:
  - `PlayerDataProvider` - implemented by classes which want to offer storage for player data
- The following new classes have been added:
  - `DatFilePlayerDataProvider` - the default player data provider, which stores `.dat` files in the `players` folder
  - `PlayerDataLoadException` - thrown when an error occurs while loading player data
  - `PlayerDataSaveException` - thrown when an error occurs while saving player data
- The following API methods have been deprecated:
  - `Player->sendTranslation()` - use `Player->sendMessage()` instead with a `Translatable` message

### `pocketmine\resourcepacks`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public ResourcePackManager->setResourceStack(list<ResourcePack> $resourceStack) : void` - sets the list of resource packs to be applied by players
  - `public ResourcePackManager->setPackEncryptionKey(string $id, ?string $key) : void` - sets the encryption key to be used for a resource pack

### `pocketmine\utils`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public static Filesystem::fileGetContents(...) : string` - a wrapper around `file_get_contents()` which throws an exception on failure

### `pocketmine\world`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public World->requestSafeSpawn(?Vector3 $spawn = null) : Promise<Position>` - an async version of `getSafeSpawn()` which generates all the needed chunks before returning

# 4.14.0
Released 8th February 2023.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.60.
- Removed support for older versions.

# 4.14.1
Released 15th February 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed all players getting kicked with `Receiving packets too fast` if a server tick takes longer than 5 seconds (e.g. because of autosave or GC).
- Fixed players getting kicked when linking with entities.

# 4.15.0
Released 17th February 2023.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.62.
- Removed support for older versions.

# 4.15.1
Released 21st February 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed dropped items not despawning when in non-ticking chunks.
- Fixed dropped items not despawning if an infinite pickup delay is set.
- Fixed infinite despawn delay (never despawn) being ignored for dropped items.

# 4.15.2
Released 24th February 2023.

## General
- Accept Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.63 (identical protocol to 1.19.62, but different version due to Mojang mixup).

## Fixes
- Fixed `World Population` timer sometimes not being stopped, causing strange results in timings reports.

# 4.15.3
Released 7th March 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed `/dumpmemory` crash when any object contained an `INF` or `NaN` float value.
- Updated RakLib for security fixes.

# 4.16.0
Released 7th March 2023.

## General
- Added granular timings for packet encode, similar to the existing timings for packet decode.
- Split `Player Network Send - Compression` timings into two timers, one for `Session Buffer` compression and one for `Broadcast` compression.
- Timings now covers several areas of the network system which were previously not counted by network timings, but were counted by total timings. This provides a better insight into the performance of the network system.

## Performance
- Improved performance of packet batch handling by avoiding unnecessary object allocations.
- Improved performance of packet broadcasting when the broadcast size is below the batch threshold. Previously, the packets would be encoded once by every recipient, but now they are encoded once and then added to the send buffer of each session in their raw form.
  - This change mostly affects servers with larger maps, where players are more widely distributed.
- Improved performance of packet broadcasting when the broadcast has only one recipient (allow the session to compress the packet with the rest of its buffer).

## Build system
- Added a new script `build/generate-bedrockdata-path-consts.php`, which must be run whenever BedrockData is updated. This script generates a class of constants with the file paths of all BedrockData files.

## API
### `pocketmine\entity`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public Entity->getGravity() : float` - returns the entity's gravity acceleration in blocks/tick^2
  - `public Entity->setGravity(float $gravity) : void` - sets the entity's gravity acceleration in blocks/tick^2

## Internals
- Now uses [`pocketmine/bedrock-data` 2.0.0](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockData/releases/tag/2.0.0+bedrock-1.19.60).
  - This version is now used by both PM4 and PM5, reducing maintenance burden.
- Now uses [`pocketmine/bedrock-protocol` 19.3.0](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockProtocol/releases/tag/19.3.0+bedrock-1.19.62).
  - This version provides new APIs for handling packet batches which enabled improving performance and adding new features, such as detailed packet encode timings.
- Crafting recipes and creative inventory data are now loaded from `recipes/legacy_recipes.json` and `recipes/legacy_creativeitems.json` respectively. Previously, these were loaded from BedrockData directly, but BedrockData 2.0 now uses a format which can't be supported in 4.x without BC breaks.
- Added dependencies on [`pocketmine/bedrock-block-upgrade-schema`](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockBlockUpgradeSchema) and [`pocketmine/bedrock-item-upgrade-schema`](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockItemUpgradeSchema). These provide mapping files no longer present in BedrockData 2.0.
- Reduced and/or eliminated most usages of `PacketBatch`, since it only appeared as a throwaway object and was therefore wasting performance.
- `Compressor` now exposes `getCompressionThreshold()` instead of `willCompress()`, which allows determining whether a batch will be compressed without allocating it.
- Added `pocketmine\data\bedrock\BedrockDataFiles`, an auto-generated class of constants with the file paths of all BedrockData files. This makes it easier to locate usages, detect unused files and avoid typos.

# 4.17.0
Released 14th March 2023.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.70.
- Removed support for older versions.

# 4.17.1
Released 22nd March 2023.

## General
- Docker images for PocketMine-MP are now published on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/pkgs/container/pocketmine-mp). The Docker Hub images will stop being maintained in the future.
- Updated translations.

## Fixes
- Fixed server crash on empty packets in certain cases.
- Fixed mushroom blocks dropping the wrong items when broken with a silk-touch tool.
- Fixed mushroom blocks giving the wrong items when block-picked.
- Fixed missing ability flag `PRIVILEGED_BUILDER`.

## Internals
- `update-updater-api.yml` workflow now uses `github.repository_owner` to make it easier to test the workflow on forks.
- Added version-specific channels to `update.pmmp.io`, such as `4`, `4.18-beta`, `4.17`, etc.
- Replaced deprecated `::set-output` commands in GitHub Actions workflows.
- `build/make-release.php` no longer automatically pushes changes, to avoid accidents when testing release workflows on forks.

# 4.17.2
Released 29th March 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed players being unable to join due to the appearance of a new `x5t` field in the JWT header of Xbox Live authentication tokens.

# 4.18.0
Released 25th March 2023.

## General
- Significantly improved server performance in congested areas of the world (lots of players and/or entities in the same area).
- Included more sections of the network system in `Player Network Send` performance timings.
- Changed the names of some performance timings to make them more user-friendly.
- Removed packet IDs from `receivePacket` and `sendPacket` performance timings, as they were not very useful.
- Added new specialized performance timings for the following:
  - Item entity base ticking (merging)
  - Player movement processing
  - Entity movement processing (collision checking section)
  - Projectile movement (all)
  - Projectile movement processing (ray tracing section)

## API
### `pocketmine\crafting`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `CraftingManager->getCraftingRecipeIndex() : array<int, CraftingRecipe>` - returns a list of all crafting recipes
  - `CraftingManager->getCraftingRecipeFromIndex(int $index) : ?CraftingRecipe` - returns the crafting recipe at the given index, or null if it doesn't exist

### `pocketmine\event\server`
- The following new classes have been added:
  - `DataPacketDecodeEvent` - called before a packet is decoded by a `NetworkSession`; useful to mitigate DoS attacks if PocketMine-MP hasn't been patched against new bugs yet

### `pocketmine\inventory\transaction`
- The following API methods have changed signatures:
  - `CraftingTransaction->__construct()` now accepts additional arguments `?CraftingRecipe $recipe = null, ?int $repetitions = null`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `TransactionBuilderInventory->getActualInventory() : Inventory` - returns the actual inventory that this inventory is a proxy for

## Internals
### Network
- Introduced new system for broadcasting entity events to network sessions.
  - This change improves performance when lots of players and/or entities are in the same area.
  - New interface `EntityEventBroadcaster` and class `StandardEntityEventBroadcaster` have been added to implement this.
  - All entity-specific `on*()` and `sync*()` methods have been removed from `NetworkSession` (internals backwards compatibility break, not covered by API version guarantee).
  - `NetworkSession` now accepts an `EntityEventBroadcaster` instance in its constructor.
  - `NetworkBroadcastUtils::broadcastEntityEvent()` can be used to efficiently broadcast events to unique broadcasters shared by several network sessions.
- All network sessions now share the same `PacketSerializerContext` and `PacketBroadcaster` by default.
  - Previously, every session had its own context, meaning that broadcast optimisations were not used, causing significant performance losses compared to 3.x.
  - This change improves performance in congested areas by allowing reuse of previously encoded packet buffers for all sessions sharing the same context.
  - Packet broadcasts are automatically encoded separately per unique `PacketSerializerContext` instance. This allows, for example, a multi-version fork to have a separate context for each protocol version, to ensure maximum broadcast efficiency while encoding different packets for different versions.
  - `PacketSerializerContext` is now passed in `NetworkSession::__construct()`, instead of being created by the session.
- `StandardPacketBroadcaster` is now locked to a single `PacketSerializer` context, reducing complexity.
- Introduced `NetworkBroadcastUtils::broadcastPackets()`, replacing `Server->broadcastPackets()`.
- `Server->broadcastPackets()` has been deprecated. It will be removed in a future version.
- Introduced support for the `ItemStackRequest` Minecraft: Bedrock network protocol.
  - This fixes a large number of inventory- and crafting-related bugs.
  - This also improves server security by closing off many code pathways that might have been used for exploits. `TypeConverter->netItemStackToCore()` is no longer used in server code, and remains for tool usage only.
  - This system is also significantly more bandwidth-efficient and has lower overhead than the legacy system.
  - This now opens the gateway to easily implement lots of gameplay features which have been missing for a long time, such as enchanting, anvils, looms, and more.
  - Significant changes have been made to `pocketmine\network\mcpe\InventoryManager` internals. These shouldn't affect plugins, but may affect plugins which use internal network API.
  - **No changes have been made to the plugin `InventoryTransaction` API**.
    - This system has been implemented as a shim for the existing PocketMine-MP transaction system to preserve plugin compatibility. Plugins using `InventoryTransactionEvent` should continue to work seamlessly.
    - The `InventoryTransaction` API will be redesigned in a future major version to make use of the new information provided by the `ItemStackRequest` system.
  - `InventoryTransactionPacket` is no longer sent by the client for "regular" inventory actions. However, it is still sent when dropping items, interacting with blocks, and using items.
- Inventory slot and content syncing is now buffered until the end of the tick. This reduces outbound network usage when the client performs multiple transactions in a single tick (e.g. crafting a stack of items).
- Renamed some `InventoryManager` internal properties to make them easier to understand.
- `TypeConverter->createInventoryAction()` has been removed.
- Packet batch limit has been lowered to `100` packets. With the introduction of `ItemStackRequest`, this is more than sufficient for normal gameplay.

### Other
- Use `Vector3::zero()` instead of `new Vector3()` in some places.

# 4.18.1
Released 27th March 2023.

## General
- `RakLibInterface` now logs the name of the currently active session if a crash occurs when processing a packet. This makes it easier to reproduce bugs, which is important to be able to fix them.
- Added more detailed debugging information to `InventoryManager->syncSelectedHotbarSlot()`.

## Fixes
- Fixed server crash when attempting to drop more of an item from a stack than available in the inventory.
- Fixed packet processing errors when editing writable books.
- Fixed packet processing errors when shift-clicking on the recipe book to craft recipes which draw from a large number of inventory slots.

# 4.18.2
Released 29th March 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed players being unable to join due to the appearance of a new `x5t` field in the JWT header of Xbox Live authentication tokens.
- Fixed items' durability appearing to reset when moving them around in the inventory.

# 4.18.3
Released 5th April 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed Average Players not being shown on timings reports when custom player classes are used.
- Fixed incorrect tick violation calculation in timings reports.
- Fixed not being able to add or remove items from the offhand slot.
- Fixed creative inventory item count corruption when taking items (some players would see 64x items in the creative inventory after rejoining or changing gamemode).
- Fixed not being able to drop items directly from the creative inventory on mobile.
- Fixed `DataPacketReceiveEvent` not being called for packets sent by `EntityEventBroadcaster`.
- `CreativeInventory::getItem()` and `CreativeInventory::getAll()` now return cloned itemstacks, to prevent accidental modification of the creative inventory.

# 4.19.0
Released 11th April 2023.

## General
- Updated the Timings system.
  - Timings records now include parent information, allowing them to be displayed in a tree view (e.g. https://timings.pmmp.io/?id=303556).
  - Timings records now include additional information, such as Peak (max time spent on any single tick), and Ticks (number of ticks the timer was active on).
  - New timings have been added for every event.
  - A new timer `Player Network Send - Pre-Spawn Game Data` has been added, and covers most of the time spent handling `ResourcePackClientResponsePacket`, giving a clearer picture of what's happening.
- Improved performance of the plugin event system.
  - By introducing some caching, the event system now has 90% less overhead than in previous versions.
- Improved performance of the random chunk ticking system.
  - The selection of ticked random chunks, and their validation for ticking, is now cached. This significantly reduces the overhead of chunk selection.
  - Factions servers and other game modes with big maps and sparsely populated areas will see the most benefit from this change.
  - Real-world performance benefit of this change is anywhere from 0-20%, depending on server type and configuration.
- The `timings paste` command now logs a debug message with the server response on failure to paste a timings report.

## API
### `pocketmine\entity\object`
- The following API constants have been added:
  - `ExperienceOrb::DEFAULT_DESPAWN_DELAY` - the default delay in ticks before an experience orb despawns
  - `ExperienceOrb::NEVER_DESPAWN` - magic value for `setDespawnDelay()` to make an experience orb never despawn
  - `ExperienceOrb::MAX_DESPAWN_DELAY` - the maximum delay in ticks before an experience orb despawns
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public ExperienceOrb->getDespawnDelay() : int` - returns the delay in ticks before this experience orb despawns
  - `public ExperienceOrb->setDespawnDelay(int $despawnDelay) : void` - sets the delay in ticks before this experience orb despawns
- The following properties have been deprecated
  - `ExperienceOrb->age` - superseded by despawn delay methods

### `pocketmine\event`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public HandlerList->getListenerList() : list<RegisteredListener>` - returns an ordered list of handlers to be called for the event

### `pocketmine\player`
- The following API methods have behavioural changes:
  - `ChunkSelector->selectChunks()` now yields the distance in chunks from the center as the key, instead of an incrementing integer.
- The following classes have been deprecated:
  - `PlayerChunkLoader` (this was technically internal, but never marked as such)

### `pocketmine\timings`
- The following API constants have been deprecated:
- `Timings::INCLUDED_BY_OTHER_TIMINGS_PREFIX` - this is superseded by timings group support (see `Timings::GROUP_BREAKDOWN`)
- The following API constants have been added:
- `Timings::GROUP_BREAKDOWN` - this group makes a timer appear in the `Minecraft - Breakdown` section of a timings report
- The following API methods have been added:
- `public TimingsHandler->getGroup() : string` - returns the name of the table in which this timer will appear in a timings report
- The following API methods have changed signatures:
- `TimingsHandler->__construct()` now accepts an additional, optional `string $group` parameter, which defaults to `Minecraft`.

### `pocketmine\world`
#### Highlights
Ticking chunks is now done using the `ChunkTicker` system, which has a much more fine-grained API than the old `TickingChunkLoader` system, as well as better performance.
It works similarly to the `ChunkLoader` system, in that chunks will be ticked as long as at least one `ChunkTicker` is registered for them.

#### API changes
- The following classes have been deprecated:
  - `TickingChunkLoader` - this has been superseded by the more powerful and performant `ChunkTicker` APIs
- The following classes have been added:
  - `ChunkTicker` - an opaque object used for `registerTickingChunk()` to instruct the `World` that we want a chunk to be ticked
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public World->registerTickingChunk(ChunkTicker $ticker, int $chunkX, int $chunkZ) : void` - registers a chunk to be ticked by the given `ChunkTicker`
  - `public World->unregisterTickingChunk(ChunkTicker $ticker, int $chunkX, int $chunkZ) : void` - unregisters a chunk from being ticked by the given `ChunkTicker`

# 4.19.1
Released 14th April 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed inventory rollbacks when spreading items in ender chests.
- Fixed inventory rollbacks when shift-clicking to craft and the outputs would have been split across multiple inventory slots.
- Fixed incorrect spawn terrain generation for newly created worlds.
- Fixed `chunk-ticking.tick-radius` not disabling chunk ticking when set to `0`.
- Fixed chunks not being ticked if they previously left a player's simulation distance without leaving their view distance.
- Fixed height of collision boxes for Grass Path and Farmland blocks.

# 4.19.2
Released 14th April 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed player timings duplication leading to extremely large timings reports when timings runs for a long time with many players.
- Packet timings are now indexed by class FQN instead of packet ID. This prevents erroneous timer reuse on packet ID reuse (e.g. multi version servers).
- Fixed entity timings being shared by different classes with the same short name. This led to incorrect timings being reported for some entities when custom entities were used.

# 4.19.3
Released 21st April 2023.

## General
- Error IDs for `Packet processing error` disconnects are now split into 4-character chunks to make them easier to type (since they can't be copied from the disconnection screen of a client).

## Fixes
- Fixed entity-block intersections being checked twice per tick. Besides wasting CPU time, this may have caused unexpected behaviour during entity-block interactions with blocks like water or cacti.
- Fixed performance issue in network inventory synchronization due item NBT being prepared twice.
- Fixed `tools/simulate-chunk-selector.php` argument parsing being completely broken (weird behaviour of PHP `getopt()`).

## Internals
- `TimingsHandler->stopTiming()` now logs an error message if a subtimer wasn't stopped, rather than throwing an exception.
  - Due to interactions between `try...finally` and unexpected errors, throwing exceptions made it difficult for plugin developers to debug errors in their plugins, since it obscured the original error.

# 4.20.0
Released 26th April 2023.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.80.
- Removed support for older versions.

## Fixes
- Fixed packet processing error when attempting to use a stonecutter.
- Fixed armor slots containing ghost items when cancelling right-click to equip armor.
- Fixed crash in `HandlerList->getListenersByPriority()` when no listeners are registered at the given priority.

## API
### `pocketmine\block`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public BaseSign->getEditorEntityRuntimeId() : int` - returns the entity runtime ID of the player currently editing this sign, or `null` if none
  - `public BaseSign->setEditorEntityRuntimeId(?int $editorEntityRuntimeId) : $this` - sets the entity runtime ID of the player currently editing this sign

### `pocketmine\player`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public Player->openSignEditor(Vector3 $position) : void` - opens the client-side sign editor GUI for the given position

# 4.20.1
Released 27th April 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed server crash when firing a bow while holding arrows in the offhand slot.

## Internals
- `ItemStackContainerIdTranslator::translate()` now requires an additional `int $slotId` parameter and returns `array{int, int}` (translated window ID, translated slot ID) to be used with `InventoryManager->locateWindowAndSlot()`.
- `InventoryManager->locateWindowAndSlot()` now checks if the translated slot actually exists in the requested inventory, and returns `null` if not. Previously, it would return potentially invalid slot IDs without checking them, potentially leading to crashes.

# 4.20.2
Released 4th May 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed all types of wooden logs appearing as oak in the inventory.
- Fixed a performance issue in `BaseInventory->canAddItem()` (missing `continue` causing useless logic to run).

# 4.20.3
Released 6th May 2023.

## Improvements
- Reduced memory usage of `RuntimeBlockMapping` from 25 MB to 9 MB. Since every thread has its own copy of the block map, this saves a substantial amount of memory.

## Fixes
- Fixed players falling through blocks in spectator mode.
- Fixed timings reports getting bloated by prolific usage of `PluginManager->registerEvent()`.
  - This was caused by creating a new timings handler for each call, regardless of whether a timer already existed for the given event and callback.
- Fixed `Full Server Tick` and other records being missing from timings reports.
  - This was caused by timings handler depth not getting reset when timings was disabled and later re-enabled.

# 4.20.4
Released 6th May 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed players being forced into flight mode in every game mode.
  - Moral of the story: do not assume anything in Mojang internals does what its name suggests...

# 4.20.5
Released 30th May 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed server crash due to a bug in upstream dependency [`netresearch/jsonmapper`](https://github.com/cweiske/JsonMapper).

# 4.21.0
Released 17th May 2023.

## General
- PHP 8.1 is now required. Most plugins should run without changes, but some might need to be updated due to language-level deprecations.
- Ticking chunk count is now shown separately from loaded chunk count in the `/status` command, providing useful performance information.
- Further improved performance of ticking chunk selection.
- Improved performance of some inventory functions.
- Reduced server memory footprint in most cases by ~9 MB per thread.
- Due to large overhead, async network compression is now only used for packets larger than 10 KB by default.

## Configuration
- Added the following new `pocketmine.yml` configuration options:
  - `network.async-compression-threshold` - minimum size of packet which will be compressed using `AsyncTask`
    - Default is 10 KB, which means that very few packets will use async compression in practice. This is because the overhead of compressing async is currently so high that it's not worth it for smaller packets.

## Timings
- Timings reports no longer include the unused metadata fields `Entities` and `LivingEntities`.
- Timings reports now correctly calculate the peak time of a timer.
  - Previously it was incorrectly recorded as the longest time spent in a single tick, rather than the longest time spent in a single activation.
  - Timings report version has been bumped to `2` to reflect this change.
- All world-specific timers now have generic aggregate timings, making it much easier to locate performance patterns across all worlds.

## Gameplay
- Players in spectator mode are no longer able to pick blocks, and now have finite resources similar to survival mode.

## API
### `pocketmine\world`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public World->getTickingChunks() : list<int>` - returns a list of chunk position hashes (a la `World::chunkHash()`) which are currently valid for random ticking

### `pocketmine\inventory`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `protected BaseInventory->getMatchingItemCount(int $slot, Item $test, bool $checkDamage, bool $checkTags) : int` - returns the number of items in the given stack if the content of the slot matches the test item, or zero otherwise
    - This should be overridden if directly extending `BaseInventory` to provide a performance-optimised version. A slow default implementation is provided, but it will be removed in the future.
  
## Internals
### Entity
- Unused `NameTag` tag is no longer saved for `Human` entities.

### Inventory
- `BaseInventory` now uses a new internal method `getMatchingItemCount()` to locate items in the inventory without useless cloning. This improves performance of various API methods, such as `addItem()`, `contains()`, and more.
- Specialization of `Inventory->isSlotEmpty()` in `BaseInventory` subclasses has been added to improve performance of some API methods.

### Network
- `RuntimeBlockMapping` no longer keeps all block palette NBT data in memory.
  - This significantly reduces server idle memory footprint.
  - For multi-version implementations, this will have a significant impact on memory usage, since a different block palette is often required to support each version.
  - NBT will be lazy-loaded into memory and cached if `getBedrockKnownStates()` is called. However, this is not used by PocketMine-MP under normal circumstances.
- Removed unnecessary usage of `Utils::validateCallableSignature()` from some internal network pathways, improving performance.

### Scheduler
- `AsyncPool` no longer double-checks progress updates on completed tasks.

### World
- Ticking chunks are now tracked in `World->validTickingChunks` and `World->recheckTickingChunks`.
    - This allows avoiding rechecking every ticking chunk for validity during ticking chunk selection, improving performance.
    - In some cases, this allows bypassing chunk selection entirely, reducing selection cost to zero.
- Registered but ineligible ticking chunks are no longer rechecked every tick.
    - This was causing wasted cycles during async worker backlog.
    - The internal system must call `markTickingChunkForRecheck()` whenever a ticking chunk's eligibility for ticking has potentially changed, rather than just when it has changed from a yes to a no.

# 4.21.1
Released 30th May 2023.

# 4.22.0
Released 7th June 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.0**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.0.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 4.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## Interim releases
If you're upgrading from 4.20.x directly to 4.22.x, please also read the following changelogs, as the interim releases contain important changes:
- [4.21.0](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.22.0/changelogs/4.21.md#4210) - PHP 8.1 minimum version, minor performance improvements

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.0.
- Removed support for older versions.

## Fixes
- Removed deprecated `ReflectionProperty::setAccessible()` calls.
- Fixed jukebox music not stopping when destroyed by an explosion.

# 4.22.1
Released 9th June 2023.

## Fixes
- Reokaced workaround for an old teleporting client bug:
  - This workaround broke due to an additional client bug introduced by 1.20, causing players to become frozen to observers when teleported.
  - The original client bug has still not been fixed, meaning a new workaround was needed, but no perfect solution could be found.
  - The new workaround involves broadcasting teleport movements as regular movements, which causes unwanted interpolation between the old and new positions, but otherwise works correctly. This solution is not ideal, but it is the best we can do for now.
  - See issues [#4394](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/issues/4394) and [#5810](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/issues/5810) for more details.

## Fixes
- Fixed server crash due to a bug in upstream dependency [`netresearch/jsonmapper`](https://github.com/cweiske/JsonMapper).

# 4.22.2
Released 1st July 2023.

## Changes
- Added obsoletion warnings to the server log at the end of the startup sequence.

## Fixes
- Fixed players being disconnected en masse with "Not authenticated" messages.
  - This occurred due to a check intended to disable the old authentication key after July 1st.
  - We expected that the new key would have been deployed by Mojang by now, but it seems like that has not yet happened.
  - Due to the lack of a hard date for the key changeover, we guessed that July 1st would be a safe bet, but this appears to have backfired.
  - This version will accept both old and new keys indefinitely.
  - A security release will be published to remove the old key after the transition occurs.

# 4.22.3
Released 11th July 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed mishandling of NBT leading to a server crash when editing signs.
- Fixed an edge case crash that could occur in `AsyncTask->__destruct()` when thread-local storage referenced other `AsyncTask` objects.

## Internals
- Added a concurrency lock to prevent the `update-updater-api` GitHub Action from running for multiple releases at the same time (which would have caused one of them to fail due to git conflicts).

# 4.23.0
Released 12th July 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.10**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.10.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 4.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.10.
- Removed support for older versions.

## Fixes
- Fixed Docker image build failure due to outdated `build/php` submodule.

# 4.23.1
Released 14th July 2023.

## Fixes
- Hardened validation of JWT signing keys in `LoginPacket`.
- Fixed server crash due to a bug in upstream dependency [`netresearch/jsonmapper`](https://github.com/cweiske/JsonMapper).

# 4.23.2
Released 18th July 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed login errors due to a new `sandboxId` field appearing in the Xbox Live authentication data in `LoginPacket`. All clients, regardless of version, are affected by this change.

# 4.23.3
Released 24th July 2023.

## Documentation
- Fixed typo in `ChunkSelector::selectChunks()` documentation.

## Fixes
- Fixed the server not stopping properly during crash conditions on *nix platforms.
- Fixed `HORSE_EQUIP` and `SMITHING_TABLE_TEMPLATE` container UI types not being handled by `ItemStackContainerIdTranslator`. This bug prevented plugins from implementing missing inventory types.
- Player emotes no longer broadcast messages to other players. This was unintended behaviour caused by a client-side behavioural change.
- Shulker boxes no longer support the placement of torches or other similar blocks.
- Fire can now be placed on upper slabs and the top of upside-down stairs.

# 4.23.4
Released 1st August 2023.

# 4.23.5
Released 9th August 2023.

## General
- Updated translation data to [pmmp/Language 2.19.6](https://github.com/pmmp/Language/releases/tag/2.19.6).

## Fixes

- Fixed `BlockDeathEvent->getOldState()` returning a block which is already dead.

# 4.23.6
Released 21st August 2023.

# 5.0.0
Released 1st June 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.19.80**

5.0.0 is a major feature update to PocketMine-MP, including support for Bedrock worlds from 1.13 onwards, a large array of new blocks and items, and various changes to the plugin API.

It is **not** compatible with plugins written for 4.x.y, and plugins may require code changes to work with it.

**As this changelog is quite large, its accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.**
Make sure you're looking at the [latest revision](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/stable/changelogs/5.0.md), as it may be amended after release.

## Core
- Worlds are now saved according to the Bedrock 1.19.80 format.
- Worlds generated by Bedrock from 1.13.0 and up are now supported (previously, only worlds up to 1.12 were supported).
- `/particle` now accepts strings for particle data instead of integers.
- `/particle` no longer accepts integers for block or item IDs.
- The usage of `blockcrack`, `iconcrack` and `blockdust` particle types in `/particle` now follows the same pattern as
  other particle types, with the data for each being passed in the `data` parameter instead of being baked into the
  particle name.
- Commands are now enabled by default in worlds exported from PocketMine-MP to Bedrock.

## Build system
- `build/generate-block-serializer-consts.php` has been added to generate `BlockTypeNames`, `BlockStateNames` and `BlockStateStringValues` in the `pocketmine\data\bedrock\block` package.
- `build/generate-item-type-names.php` has been added to generate `ItemTypeNames` in the `pocketmine\data\bedrock\item` package.
- `build/generate-runtime-enum-serializers.php` has been added to generate `RuntimeEnumSerializer`, `RuntimeEnumSerializerTrait`, and `RuntimeEnumSizeCalculatorTrait` in `pocketmine\data\runtime` package.

## Localization
- Localized disconnect messages are now used in the following cases:
  - Server full
  - Player not on the server whitelist
  - Player on the server ban list
  - Invalid skin
  - Invalid username
  - Kicked using `/kick`
  - Banned using `/ban`
  - Failure to find a safe spawn position
- Session open, session close and session player name discovery messages are now localized.
- All permissions now have localized descriptions. These are not currently used by PocketMine-MP, but may be useful for plugins.

## Performance
- Improved performance of dropping block inventory contents when the block is destroyed.
- Improved light propagation performance by 10-15%.
- [`ext-pmmpthread` version 6.0.0](https://github.com/pmmp/ext-pmmpthread/releases/tag/6.0.0) is now used, featuring significant performance improvements for thread-safe objects and various threading use-cases.

## Tools
- The following tool scripts have been added:
  - `generate-block-palette-spec.php` - generates a JSON file with a readable overview of blocks, their state
    properties, and their possible values
  - `generate-blockstate-upgrade-schema.php` - generates JSON blockstate upgrade schemas like those found
    in [BedrockBlockUpgradeSchema](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockBlockUpgradeSchema)
  - `generate-item-upgrade-schema.php` - generates JSON item ID/meta upgrade schemas like those found
    in [BedrockItemUpgradeSchema](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockItemUpgradeSchema)
  - `generate-bedrock-data-from-packets.php` - generates various files for [BedrockData](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockData)
    - This script accepts a txt file containing base64-encoded packet dumps.
    - This script has been in use for several years, but has only now been open-sourced.
    - It's used to generate data such as crafting recipes, creative inventory data, and various other blobs of data needed to support the current version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

### `pocketmine\block`
#### Highlights
- Blocks no longer use internal Minecraft IDs and metadata to identify themselves. All APIs associated with legacy IDs
  and meta have been removed.
- A new set of runtime IDs generated from `VanillaBlocks` is used to identify block types. These IDs are defined
  in `BlockTypeIds`.
  - These new IDs are used for runtime representation of blocks on chunks, and for type comparison purposes.
  - Block type IDs are used at **runtime only**. **Do not store them in configs or databases**, as they are subject to
    change without warning.
  - Block type IDs are **specific to PocketMine-MP** and have no relation to the IDs used by Minecraft.
  - Block type IDs cannot be negative
  - Block type IDs must not be reused, even if overriding an already defined block
- Block state properties (e.g. facing, colour, etc.) are now represented by PM-specific state data instead of legacy
  metadata. The state data consists of:
  - Block-item state properties - retained by items when the block is broken (colour, wet/dry, coral type, etc.) - handled by `Block->describeBlockItemState()`
  - Block-only state data - discarded when the block is broken (facing direction, lit/unlit, powered/unpowered, etc.) - handled by `Block->describeBlockOnlyState()`
- Chunks now store dynamic state ID derived from the runtime type ID and runtime (PocketMine-MP defined) state data.
- Introduced "type tags" concept, which allows marking certain blocks as having certain behaviours.
  - The idea for this system was borrowed from the Minecraft Java tags system.
  - It's still in very early concept stage, but is currently used for deciding which types of blocks plants can be placed on without needing to enumerate every single ID in every class, eliminating a bunch of boilerplate code and improving consistency.
- All `Block` descendents now accept `BlockTypeInfo` in the constructor, instead of `BlockBreakInfo`. This allows for future additions without needing to change dozens of overridden constructors.
- `&$returnedItems` reference parameter is now used in some places such as `Block->onInteract()` to enable actions to return items to players without caring about whether they are in creative or anything else.
  - This eliminates boilerplate code of deciding whether to set the player's held item or not, as well as automatically dropping any overflow items that don't fit into the inventory.
  - This is currently used when filling/emptying cauldrons using buckets or glass bottles.
- Dependency between `RuntimeBlockStateRegistry` (previously `BlockFactory`) and `VanillaBlocks` has been inverted.
  - Now, blocks types are defined in `VanillaBlocks`
  - `RuntimeBlockStateRegistry` automatically registers states for blocks defined in `VanillaBlocks`.
  - Manual registration in `RuntimeBlockStateRegistry` is still required for custom blocks (see section below about registering new blocks).
- `RuntimeBlockStateRegistry` now has only one purpose - to map internal blockstate IDs to `Block` objects when reading blocks from chunks. It should not be used by plugins unless registering new blocks.
  - To get a block at runtime, e.g. stone, use `VanillaBlocks::STONE()`
  - To load a block from **old** config or database data:
    1. Use `GlobalBlockStateHandlers::getUpgrader()->upgradeIntIdMeta()` to convert it to modern data
    2. Pass the data to `GlobalBlockStateHandlers::getDeserializer()` to get a blockstate ID
    3. Pass the blockstate ID to `RuntimeBlockStateRegistry::fromStateId()` to get a `Block` instance
  - Prefer using `StringToItemParser` wherever possible for configs and databases (see `lookupAliases()` and `lookupBlockAliases()`).

#### Registering new blocks
##### In a plugin
To add a vanilla block in a plugin which isn't yet supported by PocketMine-MP, do the following:

1. Get a new type ID using `BlockTypeIds::newId()` - _you'll want to keep this in a property somewhere if you want to
   compare using `getTypeId()` later_
2. Set up the block type somewhere - _this can be anywhere you like, e.g. a plugin main class property, but using
   a `RegistryTrait` class is recommended - you'll need this later to create new instances of the block_
3. Register the block in `RuntimeBlockStateRegistry` - _this informs the server of all the block's possible states so
   that it can be read from chunks at runtime_
4. Register a deserializer for the block's Minecraft ID in `BlockStateToObjectDeserializer` - _needed for the block to
   be recognized when loaded from disk_
5. Register a serializer for the block in `BlockObjectToStateSerializer` - _needed for the block to be saved to disk,
   and to be sent over the network_
6. Optionally, register a string alias for the block in `StringToItemParser` - _so that it can be given via `/give`_

To see a demo of how to do this in a plugin, see [this example plugin](https://github.com/pmmp/RegisterBlocksDemoPM5).

Registering custom blocks follows a similar process, but requires additional steps to modify `BlockStateDictionary`
which won't be covered here.
Since this is not currently officially supported by PocketMine-MP, this won't be covered here.

This is admittedly rather more of a hassle than in PM4, but this system offers significantly more flexibility than the
old system.

##### As a PocketMine-MP core contribution
To register a new vanilla block into the core, the process is slightly different:

1. Instead of using `BlockTypeIds::newId()`, add a new constant for the block to `BlockTypeIds`
2. Register the new block in `VanillaBlocks` - `RuntimeBlockStateRegistry` will automagically take notice of all blocks
   defined in `VanillaBlocks`
3. Follow steps 4 onwards above

  - `public utils\SignText->getBaseColor() : \pocketmine\color\Color`
  - `public utils\SignText->isGlowing() : bool`
- The following classes now use new traits, adding API methods and/or properties:
  - `FenceGate` uses `utils\WoodTypeTrait`
  - `GlazedTerracotta` uses `utils\ColoredTrait`
  - `Planks` uses `utils\WoodTypeTrait`
  - `Wood` uses `utils\WoodTypeTrait`
  - `WoodenButton` uses `utils\WoodTypeTrait`
  - `WoodenDoor` uses `utils\WoodTypeTrait`
  - `WoodenFence` uses `utils\WoodTypeTrait`
  - `WoodenPressurePlate` uses `utils\WoodTypeTrait`
  - `WoodenSlab` uses `utils\WoodTypeTrait`
  - `WoodenStairs` uses `utils\WoodTypeTrait`
  - `WoodenTrapdoor` uses `utils\WoodTypeTrait`
- The following API interface requirements have been added (BC breaking):
  - `public utils\Fallable->getFallDamagePerBlock() : float` (default implementation provided by `utils\FallableTrait`)

  - `public utils\Fallable->getMaxFallDamage() : float` (default implementation provided by `utils\FallableTrait`)
  - `public utils\Fallable->onHitGround(FallingBlock $blockEntity) : bool` (default implementation provided by `utils\FallableTrait`)

### `pocketmine\command`
- Command permissions are now always checked by the server when running a command.
  - This only affects commands implemented by extending `Command`. Plugins using `PluginBase->onCommand()` are not affected by this change, since they already had permissions checked by the server anyway.
  - Previously, direct inheritors of `Command` were responsible for checking permissions, which required developers to duplicate the same code in every command, and opened lots of potential for security vulnerabilities.
  - If you want to do something on permission denied (e.g. sending a special message, or audit logging), you can do so by overriding `Command->testPermission()`, instead of baking the code directly into `Command->execute()`.
  - If you don't want to use permissions at all, just create a permission with a default of `true` (or belonging to `pocketmine.group.user`) and assign that.
- `SimpleCommandMap` now requires all commands to have a permission set when registered.
  - If you actually want to allow everyone to use your command (not advised), you can add a new permission to the `pocketmine.group.user` group, or use `default: true` for `plugin.yml` permissions.
- The following API methods have changed behaviour:
  - `Command->testPermissionSilent()` now returns `false` if there are no permissions associated with the command. This is to prevent commands with no permissions being usable by everyone, which has previously been a source of security issues.
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public Command->getPermissions() : list<string>` - returns a list of permissions which grant usage access to this command. A user with one or more of these permissions will be able to invoke the command's `execute()` method
  - `public Command->setPermissions(list<string> $permissions) : void` - sets the permissions which grant usage access to this command. This should be used instead of `setPermission()` with `;` separators (which is now deprecated)

- The following API methods have signature changes:
  - `FurnaceRecipe->__construct()` now accepts `RecipeIngredient` instead of `Item`
  - `FurnaceRecipe->getInput()` now returns `RecipeIngredient` instead of `Item`

  - `PlayerPreLoginEvent->setKickReason()` -> `PlayerPreLoginEvent->setKickFlag()`

### `pocketmine\item`
#### Highlights
- `ItemFactory` has been removed. Vanilla item registration is now done via `VanillaItems`.
  - To get an item at runtime, e.g. iron ingot, use `VanillaItems::IRON_INGOT()`
  - To get a block as an item, e.g. stone, use `VanillaBlocks::STONE()->asItem()`
  - To load an item from legacy ID and meta:
    1. Use `GlobalItemDataHandlers::getUpgrader()->upgradeItemTypeDataInt()` to convert the legacy ID and meta to `SavedItemStackData`
    2. Pass the itemstack data to `GlobalItemDataHandlers::getDeserializer()` to get an `Item` instance
- Items no longer use internal Minecraft string IDs and metadata to identify themselves. All APIs associated with legacy
  IDs and/or meta have been removed.
- A new set of runtime item IDs generated from `VanillaItems` is now used to identify item types. These IDs are defined
  in `ItemTypeIds`.
  - These new IDs are primarily intended for type comparison purposes.
  - Item type IDs are used at **runtime only**. They should **NOT** be stored in configs or databases, as they are not
    guaranteed to remain the same between versions.
- In some cases, items may have additional "type data" which provides extra type information about an item. This
  replaces item metadata in some cases.
  - Type data may be used to store dynamic type information such as dye colour, potion type, etc.
  - Items must have the same type ID **and** type data in order to be stackable.
- Blocks, when represented as items:
  - retain their block type data, but not state data (for example, different colours of concrete don't stack, but things
    like facing don't affect stackability)
  - use the negative of their block type ID (e.g. a block with type ID `1` will have an item type ID of `-1`).
- Durable items (e.g. tools, armour) now use NBT `Damage` tag to store durability (like Minecraft 1.13+), instead of
  legacy meta values.
- `&$returnedItems` reference parameter is now used in some places (e.g. `onInteractBlock()`) to enable actions to return items to players without caring about whether they are in creative or anything else.
  - This eliminates boilerplate code of deciding whether to set the player's held item or not, as well as automatically dropping any overflow items that don't fit into the inventory.
  - This is used for things like filling/emptying buckets and bottles, and equipping armor.
- Blocks which previously had separate items, such as mob heads and beds, no longer do. Their item form can be acquired using `Block->asItem()` in the same way as every other block. This is facilitated by the new serializer system.

#### Implementing new items
##### In a plugin
This follows a similar process to registering blocks.

1. Get a new type ID using `ItemTypeIds::newId()` - _you'll want to keep this in a property somewhere if you want to
   compare using `getTypeId()` later_
2. Set up the item type somewhere - _this can be anywhere you like, e.g. a plugin main class property, but using
   a `RegistryTrait` class is recommended - you'll need this later to create new instances of the item_
3. Register a deserializer in `ItemDeserializer` - _needed for the item to be recognized when loaded from disk_
4. Register a serializer in `ItemSerializer` - _needed for the item to be saved to disk, and to be sent over the
   network_
5. Optionally, register a string alias for the item in `StringToItemParser` - _so that it can be given via `/give`_

To see a demo of how to do this in a plugin, see [this example plugin](https://github.com/pmmp/RegisterBlocksDemoPM5).

Again, it's acknowledged this is rather more cumbersome than it should be, but this is an ongoing process.

##### As a PocketMine-MP core contribution

To register a new vanilla item into the core, the process is slightly different:

1. Instead of using `ItemTypeIds::newId()`, add a new constant for the block to `ItemTypeIds`
2. Register the new item in `VanillaItems`
3. Follow steps 3 onwards from the plugin instructions above

#### Change list
- `Item` is no longer `json_encode()`-able.
  - The original purpose of this was to allow items to be serialized to JSON for crafting data generated from `CraftingDataPacket`. Due to changes in the generation methodology, bypassing `Item`s entirely, this is no longer necessary.
  - In addition, `jsonSerialize()` required the item to know about the method by which it will be serialized (since there is no way to inject context), creating a cyclic dependency between the `Item` implementation and its serialization method.
  - It's relatively easy to write a replacement method to encode items to JSON as you desire.
  - `Item::legacyJsonDeserialize()` (previously `Item::jsonDeserialize()`) is retained to allow loading legacy data, although it may be removed in the future.
- The following classes have been removed:
  - `Bed`
  - `ItemFactory`
  - `ItemIds`
  - `Skull`

  - `public ArmorTypeInfo->isFireProof() : bool`
  - `public Boat->getType() : BoatType`
  - `public Dye->setColor(\pocketmine\block\utils\DyeColor $color) : $this`
  - `public Item->getStateId() : int` - returns a runtime numeric state ID for comparisons including information such as coral type, dye color, etc. - DO NOT save this to disk or databases
  - `public Item->getTypeId() : int` - returns a runtime numeric type ID for comparisons - DO NOT save this to disk or databases
  - `public Item->isFireProof() : bool`
  - `public ItemIdentifer->getTypeId() : int`
  - `public Potion->setType(PotionType $type) : $this`
  - `public SplashPotion->setType(PotionType $type) : $this`
  - `public StringToItemParser->lookupAliases(Item $item) : list<string>` - returns a list of all registered aliases for the given item
  - `public StringToItemParser->lookupBlockAliases(Block $block) : list<string>` - returns a list of all registered aliases for the given block
  - `public static ItemIdentifier::fromBlock(Block $block) : self`
- The following API methods have been removed:
  - `Boat->getWoodType()`
  - `Item->getId()` - for type comparisons, use `Item->getTypeId()` instead
  - `Item->getMeta()` - use the item's specific API methods to compare information such as colour, potion type etc.
  - `Item->hasAnyDamageValue()` - for meta wildcard recipe ingredients, use `pocketmine\crafting\MetaWildcardRecipeIngredient` instead
  - `ItemIdentifier->getId()`
  - `ItemIdentifier->getMeta()`
- The following API methods have been renamed:
  - `Item::jsonDeserialize()` -> `Item::legacyJsonDeserialize()`

  - `Item->onReleaseUsing()` now accepts `array<Item> &$returnedItems` reference parameter.
  - `ItemIdentifier->__construct()` no longer accepts a `$variant` parameter, and now expects an item type ID for the ID parameter
  - `LegacyStringToItemParser->addMapping()` now accepts a string for ID, instead of an integer
- The following API methods have behaviour changes:
  - `Item->equals()`'s `$checkDamage` parameter is now ignored, as tool damage is now stored as an NBT tag. This parameter wasn't removed due to being followed by a second `bool` parameter, which would potentially end up in the wrong place and silently cause bugs in updated plugins.
  - `Item->equals()`'s `$checkTags` parameter will now cause tool and armor damage to be checked if true.

  - `BiomeArray` - `PalettedBlockArray` is now used for 3D biome data
- The following API methods have changed signatures:
  - `Chunk->getBiomeId()` now accepts `int $x, int $y, int $z` instead of `int $x, int $z`

## Internals
- All external usages of `KnownTranslationKeys` are now removed. All localized messages are now sent using `Translatable` objects (usually from `KnownTranslationFactory`).
- All usages of NBT keys now use class constants instead of hardcoded strings (except for an occasional overlooked one).
- Built-in commands now declare their names inside the class constructor, rather than accepting them as parameters. This improves code consistency.
- Commands now use an array for permissions internally, instead of a string separated by `;`.
- Make use of `Item->canStackWith()` instead of `Item->equals()` wherever possible, to make the code more readable.
- Moved command timings to `Timings`.
- Overriding of serializers and deserializers of items and blocks is now consistently disallowed. Since overriding stuff is non-cooperative, it doesn't make any sense in plugins, which must coexist with other plugins. If you want to modify the functionality of built-in stuff, you have several alternative options:
    - Use existing API (e.g. events, API methods) - most uses of overrides in PM4 and earlier were abuses that could have been done with events
    - Submit feature proposals or pull requests for new API to be added (e.g. new events)
    - Register completely custom items, and reuse behaviour from the item you want to mimic
    - Fork PocketMine-MP and alter the code directly - this way your plugins aren't pretending to be cooperative with other plugins
- `level.dat`, block, item, entity, tile and chunk data are now tagged with a version ID as per `VersionInfo::WORLD_DATA_VERSION`. This allows the server to apply fixes to older worlds if necessary.
- Protocol creative inventory entries are now cached in `CreativeInventoryCache` to improve performance of initial join and game mode changes.
- Singletons in the `pocketmine\network\mcpe\convert` package have been centralized under `TypeConverter`. In the future, this will be injected where needed, allowing different converters to be used for different sessions (useful for multiversion).
- `BlockStateDictionary` memory usage is now reduced from 9 MB to 3.5 MB using various techniques, including string reuse and binary-encoded states.
- `NetworkSession` disconnect APIs now accept `Translatable|string` instead of `string` to allow localized disconnect messages.
- `NetworkSession` disconnect methods have been altered to allow specifying a different disconnect reason and disconnection screen message.
- `RuntimeBlockMapping` has been renamed to `BlockTranslator`.

# 5.1.0
Released 7th June 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.0**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.0.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.0.
- Removed support for older versions.

# 5.1.1
Released 7th June 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed blockstates being saved with the wrong version ID for 1.20.0.

# 5.1.2
Released 9th June 2023.

**This release includes changes from the following releases:**
- [4.22.1](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.22.1/changelogs/4.22.md#4221) - Teleportation client bug workarounds

This release contains no other changes.

# 5.1.3
Released 1st July 2023.

**This release includes changes from the following releases:**
- [4.22.2](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.22.2/changelogs/4.22.md#4222) - Authentication time bomb fix

## General
- Updated logos to new RGB-style logo. Thanks to @MrCakeSlayer and @HBIDamian for their efforts.
- Improved error messages generated by the world system when some version tags are missing from `level.dat` in Bedrock worlds.
- Outsourced Composer dependencies now only receive patch updates automatically (pinned using the `~` constraint).
  - Minor and major updates now require manually updating `composer.json`, to ensure that the plugin API is not broken by libraries getting randomly updated from one patch release to the next.

## Documentation
- Updated doc comment for `Player->setGamemode()` to remove outdated information.
- Added documentation for the `$clickVector` parameter of `Block->onInteract()` to specify that it is relative to the block's position.
- Added missing `@required` tag for `BlockStateUpgradeSchemaModelBlockRemap->newState`.

## Fixes
- Fixed blue candles not appearing in the creative inventory.
- Fixed server crash when block-picking candle cakes.
- `World->useItemOn()` now ensures that the `$clickVector` components are always in the range of 0-1. Previously, any invalid values were accepted, potentially leading to a crash.

# 5.2.0
Released 4th July 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.0**

This is a minor technical update, including changes to AsyncTask error handling and support for BedrockBlockUpgradeSchema version 3.0.0.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## Core
- [BedrockBlockUpgradeSchema version 3.0.0]() is now supported.
- [`ext-pmmpthread` version 6.0.4]() is now required (bug fixes required to support technical changes in this release).

## Performance
- Improved performance of `AsyncPool->submitTask()` and `AsyncPool->submitTaskToWorker()`.
- Added new timings for `AsyncTask->onProgressUpdate()` and `AsyncTask->onCompletion()`.

## Gameplay
### Blocks
- Added the following new blocks:
  - Cherry Button
  - Cherry Door
  - Cherry Fence
  - Cherry Fence Gate
  - Cherry Leaves
  - Cherry Log
  - Cherry Planks
  - Cherry Pressure Plate
  - Cherry Sign
  - Cherry Slab
  - Cherry Stairs
  - Cherry Trapdoor
  - Cherry Wood
  - Glow Lichen
  - Piglin Head

## Tools
- `generate-block-upgrade-schema.php` now supports generating schemas a la BedrockBlockUpgradeSchema version 3.0.0, using `newFlattenedName` to reduce schema size.
- Improved property remapping detection in `generate-block-upgrade-schema.php`. It now detects related properties with more confidence (even when multiple properties were change), and no longer considers unrelated properties as mapped (e.g. `mapped_type` and `deprecated` in 1.9->1.10).

## API
### `pocketmine\data\bedrock\block`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public BlockStateData->toVanillaNbt() : CompoundTag` - returns the NBT for the blockstate without any PMMP extra metadata (`toNbt()` will normally include a `PMMPDataVersion` tag).

### `pocketmine\data\runtime`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public RuntimeDataDescriber->facingFlags(list<int> $faces) : void`

### `pocketmine\scheduler`
- `AsyncTask->onRun()` no longer tolerates uncaught exceptions.
  - This means that any uncaught exceptions thrown from `AsyncTask->onRun()` will now crash the worker thread, and by extension, the server.
  - This change makes it easier to debug errors by detecting them earlier.
- The following API methods have been deprecated:
  - `AsyncTask->onError()`

## Internals
- `AsyncTask->progressUpdates` is now lazily initialized when a task publishes a progress update.
  - This was previously not possible due to technical limitations of the `ext-pmmpthread` extension.
  - This change improves performance of `AsyncPool->submitTask()` and `AsyncPool->submitTaskToWorker()`, as well as reducing the amount of work needed to check for progress updates on tick.
- Errors in `AsyncWorker` now cascade and crash the whole server.
  - This makes it easier to debug errors by detecting them earlier.
  - This includes all types of unexpected errors, such as OOM, uncaught exceptions, etc.
  - This change is not expected to affect normal server operation, as worker threads are not expected to crash under normal circumstances.
- `AsyncTask::$threadLocalStorage` now uses a plain `array` instead of `ArrayObject`. The `ArrayObject` was a workaround for `ext-pthreads` to prevent thread-locals getting copied to the worker thread, and is no longer necessary.
- Regenerated `pocketmine\data\bedrock\item\ItemTypeNames` for Bedrock 1.20 (BC breaking, some item names have changed).
- Fixed `build/generate-item-type-names.php` not including some newer blockitems, such as doors and hanging signs.

# 5.2.1
Released 11th July 2023.

**This release includes changes from the following releases:**
- [4.22.3](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.22.3/changelogs/4.22.md#4223) - Fixes for some crash issues

This release contains no other changes.

# 5.3.0
Released 12th July 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.10**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.10.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## Interim releases
If you're upgrading directly from 5.1.x to 5.3.x, please also read the following changelogs, as the interim releases contain important changes:
- [5.2.0](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/5.2.0/changelogs/5.2.md#520)

## Included releases
**This release includes changes from the following releases:**
- [4.23.0](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.23.0/changelogs/4.23.md#4230) - Support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.10

## Internals
- `BlockTypeNames`, `BlockStateNames`, `BlockStateStringValues` and `ItemTypeNames` in the `pocketmine\data\bedrock` package have BC-breaking changes to accommodate Bedrock 1.20.10.

# 5.3.1
Released 14th July 2023.

## Included releases
**This release includes changes from the following releases:**
- [4.23.1](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.23.1/changelogs/4.23.md#4231) - Security fixes

# 4.23.2
Released 18th July 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed login errors due to a new `sandboxId` field appearing in the Xbox Live authentication data in `LoginPacket`. All clients, regardless of version, are affected by this change.

# 4.23.4
Released 1st August 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed exponentially increasing lag when many hundreds of non-mergeable dropped items occupied the same space. This disproportionately affected SkyBlock servers due to large cactus farms using water to collect items together. 

# 5.3.2
Released 18th July 2023.

## Included releases
**This release includes changes from the following releases:**
- [4.23.2](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.23.2/changelogs/4.23.md#4232) - Fix for `sandboxId`-related login errors

## Documentation
- Fixed documentation error in `StringToTParser`.

## Fixes
- Fixed turtle helmet not being able to be unequipped.

## Internals
- Armor pieces are no longer set back into the armor inventory if no change was made. This reduces the number of slot updates sent to clients, as well as avoiding unnecessary updates for armor pieces which have Unbreaking enchantments.

## General
- Updated `build/php` submodule to pmmp/PHP-Binaries@e0c918d1379465964acefd562d9e48f87cfc2c9e.

# 5.3.3
Released 24th July 2023.

## Included releases
**This release includes changes from the following releases:**
- [4.23.3](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.23.3/changelogs/4.23.md#4233) - Various bug fixes

## Fixes
- Added a workaround for PM4 worlds with chunks corrupted by [Refaltor77/CustomItemAPI](https://github.com/Refaltor77/CustomItemAPI).
  - While this was not the fault of PocketMine-MP itself, a significant number of users were affected by this problem.
  - This error was not detected by PM4 due to missing validation of certain data which should not have existed in 1.12.
  - An error will now be logged when this corruption is detected, but the affected chunks should otherwise load normally.
- Relaxed validation of expected 3D biome array counts per chunk in LevelDB worlds.
  - Vanilla Bedrock currently saves 24 palettes (and only 24 are required), but it saved 25, 32, or 64 biome palettes per chunk in older versions.
  - Core validation for these padding biomes was very strict, enforcing exact compliance with vanilla.
  - Since only 24 palettes are actually required, the remaining palettes may now be omitted irrespective of the chunk version.
  - An error will still be logged when this mistake is detected, but the affected chunks will otherwise load normally.
- Fixed `/kill` not working on players who had (re)spawned in the 3 seconds immediately after (re)spawning (due to `noDamageTicks`).
- Fixed `/kill` not working correctly for players with high levels of Health Boost or other health-altering effects.
- Fixed netherite items being destroyed by lava.
- Fireproof entities no longer display the burning animation when in fire or lava. This does not apply to creative players, who are immortal rather than being fireproof.
- Fixed frosted ice melting in certain conditions which didn't match vanilla Bedrock.

# 5.3.4
Released 1st August 2023.

## Included releases
This release includes changes from the following releases:
- [4.23.4](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/4.23.4/changelogs/4.23.md#4234) - Item entity lag fix

This release contains no other significant changes.

# 5.4.0
Released 1st August 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.10**

This is a minor feature update, including a handful of new gameplay features, new plugin APIs and improvements to error reporting.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Improved error reporting for async task and thread crashes.
- Players may now have different creative inventories.

## Gameplay
### General
- Added support for 1.5-block height sneaking.
- Fixed missing player arm swing and sounds when punching the air.

### Blocks
- Implemented the following new blocks:
  - Big Dripleaf Head
  - Big Dripleaf Stem
  - Small Dripleaf
- Acacia saplings now grow into acacia trees.
- Fixed melon and pumpkin stems not attaching to the correct block when growing.
- Various blocks now drop more items when mined with a compatible tool enchanted with Fortune.

### Items
- Implemented Strong Slowness potion.
- Implemented Fortune enchantment.

## API
### `pocketmine\block`
- The following new classes have been added:
  - `utils\FortuneDropHelper` - utility methods for calculating the drop counts for Fortune-affected blocks
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `protected Block->getAdjacentSupportType(int $facing) : utils\SupportType` - returns the type of support provided by the block in the given direction on the adjacent face

### `pocketmine\entity`
- The following new API constants have been added:
  - `Living::DEFAULT_KNOCKBACK_FORCE`
  - `Living::DEFAULT_KNOCKBACK_VERTICAL_LIMIT`

### `pocketmine\entity\animation`
- `ConsumingItemAnimation` now accepts `Living` instances instead of just `Human`.

### `pocketmine\event`
- The following new classes have been added:
  - `PlayerMissSwingEvent` - called when the player attempts the attack action (left click on desktop) without any target
    - This is possible thanks to the introduction of new flags in `PlayerAuthInputPacket` in Bedrock 1.20.10
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public EntityDamageByEntityEvent->getVerticalKnockBackLimit() : float`
  - `public EntityDamageByEntityEvent->setVerticalKnockBackLimit(float $verticalKnockBackLimit) : void` - sets the max vertical velocity that can result from the victim being knocked back

### `pocketmine\player`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public Player->getCreativeInventory() : pocketmine\inventory\CreativeInventory`
  - `public Player->setCreativeInventory(pocketmine\inventory\CreativeInventory $inventory) : void`
  - `public Player->missSwing() : void` - performs actions associated with the attack action when there is no target (see `PlayerMissSwingEvent`)

### `pocketmine\scheduler`
- Cancellation functionality has been removed from `AsyncTask`, as it didn't make any sense and wasn't used by anything for what it was intended for.
  - It broke sequential task execution - later tasks might depend on state from earlier tasks
  - It didn't actually cancel the task anyway - at best, it prevented it from running, but couldn't interrupt it (though interrupting a task does not make sense either)
- The following API methods have been deprecated, and their functionality has been removed:
  - `AsyncTask->hasCancelledRun()`
  - `AsyncTask->cancelRun()`

## Internals
- Uncaught exceptions and fatal errors in `AsyncTask`, threads extending `pocketmine\thread\Thread`, and `pocketmine\thread\Worker` are now recorded in crashdumps, making it significantly easier to debug errors in these areas.
- JWT signature DER <-> raw conversions are now handled in-house using code in `JwtUtils`
  - Due to the simplicity of the conversion and only requiring a tiny subset of the ASN.1 spec, it didn't make much sense to introduce another dependency.
  - `fgrosse/phpasn1` is no longer required. This package was abandoned by its author and only used by PocketMine-MP for this one purpose.
- Various usages of `Closure::fromCallable()` have been replaced by PHP 8.1 first-class callable syntax.
- Blocks requiring support shifted to a "can be supported at" model, rather than "can be supported by".
  - This model reduces repeated logic when placing and performing nearby block updates (no need to hardcode facing everywhere).
  - In addition, this change facilitates the use of the newly introduced `Block->getAdjacentSupportType()` API method, reducing boilerplate support-type checking code.
- Bell block code has been simplified and cleaned up.
- `TallGrass` and `DoubleTallGrass` now use a shared `TallGrassTrait` to reduce code duplication.

# 5.4.1
Released 8th August 2023.

## General
- Updated translation data to [pmmp/Language 2.19.6](https://github.com/pmmp/Language/releases/tag/2.19.6).
- [`ext-pmmpthread` 6.0.7](https://github.com/pmmp/ext-pmmpthread/releases/tag/6.0.7) is now required (needed for bug fixes).

## Fixes
- Fixed Podzol not dropping itself when mined with Silk Touch.
- Fixed `World->getSafeSpawn()` not accepting positions below `y=0` (world height limit change).
- Fixed `pocketmine\thread\Thread` and `pocketmine\thread\Worker` instances not logging any information when they crash.
- Fixed `CraftItemEvent` not cloning returned items.

## Internals
- Foreach by-reference is now disallowed via a custom PHPStan rule.

# 5.4.2
Released 9th August 2023.

# 5.4.3
Released 21st August 2023.

## Included releases

## Fixes
- Fixed crashdumps not generating correctly on fatal errors.
- Fixed `PotionCauldron::setPotionItem()` not validating the item type.
- Fixed chorus fruit not considering teleport destinations below y=0.
- Fixed cake dropping itself when mined.

# 5.5.0
Released 6th September 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.10**

This is a minor feature release, including performance improvements, new API methods, and new gameplay features.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## Dependencies
- Updated `pocketmine/math` dependency to [`1.0.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/Math/releases/tag/1.0.0).
- Updated `pocketmine/nbt` dependency to [`1.0.0`](https://github.com/pmmp/NBT/releases/tag/1.0.0).

## Performance
- Some events are now no longer fired if no handlers are registered.
  - This improves performance by avoiding unnecessary object allocations and function calls.
  - Events such as `DataPacketReceiveEvent`, `DataPacketSendEvent` and `PlayerMoveEvent` are optimized away almost completely by this change, offering some much-needed performance gains.
- Significantly improved performance of small moving entities, such as dropped items.
  - This was achieved by a combination of changes, which together improved observed performance with 2000 item entities moving in water by 30-40%.
  - The benefit of this will be most noticeable in SkyBlock servers, where large cactus farms can generate thousands of dropped items.
- `World->getCollisionBoxes()` now uses an improved search method, which reduces the work done by the function by almost 90% for small entities.
  - This improves performance of collision detection for small entities, such as dropped items.

## Gameplay
### General
- Implemented enchanting using an enchanting table (yes, finally!)
  - Thanks to [@S3v3Nice](https://github.com/S3v3Nice) for investing lots of time and effort into developing this.
  - Since this feature is quite complex, it's possible there may be bugs. Please be vigilant and report any issues you find.

### Blocks
- The following new blocks have been implemented:
  - Pink Petals
- Pressure plates are now functional, in the sense that they react when entities stand on them and perform the correct logic.
  - Note that since redstone is not yet implemented, pressure plates do not activate any redstone devices, similar to buttons and levers.
- Signs can now be edited by right-clicking them.
- Signs can now be waxed using a honeycomb, which prevents them from being edited.

### Items

  - `PluginBase->getResource()` - prefer using `getResourcePath()` with `file_get_contents()` or other PHP built-in functions instead

### `pocketmine\resourcepacks`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public ResourcePackManager->setResourcePacksRequired(bool $value) : void` - sets whether players must accept resource packs in order to join

### `pocketmine\world\generator`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public GeneratorManager->addAlias(string $name, string $alias) : void` - allows registering a generator alias without copying the generator registration parameters

### `pocketmine\world\sound`
- The following new classes have been added:
- `PressurePlateActivateSound`
- `PressurePlateDeactivateSound`

### `pocketmine\utils`
- The following new API methods have been added:
  - `public StringToTParser->registerAlias(string $existing, string $alias) : void` - allows registering a string alias without copying registration parameters

## Internals
- Various `TypeIdMap` classes in the `pocketmine\data\bedrock` package now use the new `IntSaveIdMapTrait` to reduce code duplication.
- Added a new `ServerProperties` class containing constants for all known `server.properties` keys.
- Added a new `YmlServerProperties` class containing generated constants for all known `pocketmine.yml` keys. These keys can be used with `Config->getNested()`.

# 5.6.0
Released 20th September 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.30**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.30.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.30.
- Removed support for older versions.

## Fixes
- Fixed support conditions for hanging roots, cave vines and dead bushes.
- Fixed connection conditions for fences, glass panes, iron bars, and walls.

# 5.6.1
Released 20th October 2023.

## Performance
- Improved performance of cactus growth by disabling neighbour updates when only the age property was updated. While this isn't a perfect solution, it provides significant performance gains for servers with large cactus farms.

## Fixes
- Fixed `tools/generate-bedrock-data-from-packets.php` incorrectly interpreting network meta as blockstates in some cases (broken crafting recipes).
- Fixed crafting recipes involving beds, skulls and some other items not working correctly (incorrectly interpreted data).
- Fixed crashes when flower pot or cauldron blockentities exist in places where they shouldn't (leftovers from upgraded PM3 worlds).
- Fixed `Entity->broadcastSound()` not firing `WorldSoundEvent` (bypassing internal sound system).
- Fixed wooden signs, buttons and doors not being able to be used as furnace fuel.
- Fixed bone meal and tools only working when used on the top side of dirt and grass. Bone meal now works from any side, and tools work on any side except the bottom.

# 5.7.0
Released 26th October 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.40**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.40.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.40.
- Removed support for older versions.

## Fixes
- Fixed `cartography_table`, `smithing_table`, `stripped_cherry_log` and `stripped_cherry_wood` not working in `StringToItemParser`.
- Fixed `Promise<null>::onCompletion()` always calling the reject handler if the promise was already completed.

# 5.7.1
Released 1st November 2023.

## Fixes
- Fixed non-reentrant-safe code in `PermissionManager` and various other subscriber subsystems.
  - These issues caused server crashes when deleting a subscriber indirectly triggered the deletion of other subscribers (e.g. due to the GC activating in `unset()`).

# 5.8.0
Released 1st November 2023.

**Borked release, forgot to merge branches.**

# 5.8.1
Released 1st November 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.40**

This is a minor feature release, including new gameplay features, various performance improvements to internal `World` and `Block` systems, and changes to the API.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Neighbour block updates now have a separate timer for timings. Previously, these were counted under `Scheduled Block Updates`, which was misleading.

## Performance
- `LightUpdate` now avoids attempting to propagate back in the same direction the light came from. This produces a small performance improvement of around 6% in light propagation.
- Improved worst-case (non-cached) performance of `World::getCollisionBlocks()` (and its successor `World::getBlockCollisionBlocks()`).
  - While 5.5.0 introduced caching at the `World` level for AABBs, the cache was rarely useful due to entity and player movement being too unpredictable. This meant that most users saw a performance degradation with lots of moving entities, except in specific situations.
  - Performance for fetching non-cached AABBs for a cell is now improved by 2x. Overall performance benefit to a server depends on the number of entities and players.
- Added cache for hydrated farmland blocks to remember the last known location of nearby water.
  - If nearby water sources are not changed, this cache allows hydrated farmland to completely avoid checking up to 161 nearby blocks for water after the first check.
  - Tests with large wheat farms showed a 25% performance improvement in overall server performance compared to previous 5.x versions.
- Migrated various internal enums to native PHP 8.1 enums. Bypassing magic `__callStatic()` accessors improved performance in many areas, although it's hard to quantify the exact benefit.
- Made use of `Facing::OFFSET` constant in various places to avoid unnecessary `Vector3` and `Position` object allocations. Many pathways benefit from this, including neighbour block updates (due to faster `Block::getSide()` and less useless objects).
- Avoided clearing block AABB caches except when strictly necessary. Previously, the cache was wiped every time blocks were read from the world, making them mostly useless.
- Avoided random updates on blocks which have reached their final state, such as fully-grown crops. This produces a minimal performance improvement.
- Removed useless checks in some `World` hot paths.

## API
### General
- All enums have been migrated to native PHP 8.1 enums.
  - For now, the old APIs and accessors are still usable (via `LegacyEnumShimTrait`), but these will be removed in the next major release.
  - `EnumTrait` has been deprecated, and will be removed in the next major release.
  - Migration for most plugin developers will simply involve deleting `()` from the end of enum case usages, which is a trivial change and also improves performance.
  - Plugin usages of `EnumTrait` are encouraged to move to native enums, optionally using `LegacyEnumShimTrait` to provide backwards compatibility.
    - See [this code](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/9832fe899f13a8ea47cc9d73de7088f7775a12f5/src/block/utils/DyeColor.php#L85-L107) for an example of how to associate properties with enum cases (since native enums don't support this directly).
  - Thanks to improvements in `RuntimeDataDescriber`, any native enum can now be used as a custom block's state property.

### `pocketmine\block`
- The following classes have been added:
  - `utils\AgeableTrait` - used by blocks which have an age property, such as crops
  - `utils\StaticSupportTrait` - used by blocks which have the same support requirements regardless of their state, such as crops

### `pocketmine\data\runtime`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public RuntimeDataDescriber->boundedIntAuto(int $min, int $max, int &$value) : void` - similar to `boundedInt()`, but automatically calculates the needed number of bits based on the given min/max
  - `public RuntimeDataDescriber->enum(T extends \UnitEnum &$case) : void` - describes any native PHP 8.1 enum case
  - `public RuntimeDataDescriber->enumSet(array<int, T extends \UnitEnum> &$set, array<int, T extends \UnitEnum> $allCases) : void` - describes a set of enum cases (similar to bitflags)
- The following API methods have been deprecated:
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->bellAttachmentType()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->boundedInt()` - use `boundedIntAuto()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->brewingStandSlots()` - use `enumSet()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->copperOxidation()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->coralType()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->dirtType()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->dripleafState()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->dyeColor()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->froglightType()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->leverFacing()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->medicineType()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->mobHeadType()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->mushroomBlockType()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->potionType()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->slabType()` - use `enum()` instead
  - `RuntimeDataDescriber->suspiciousStewType()` - use `enum()` instead

### `pocketmine\player`
- `TitleID` is now included in `PlayerInfo` metadata for plugin consumption.

### `pocketmine\world`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public World->getBlockCollisionBoxes(AxisAlignedBB $bb) : list<AxisAlignedBB>` - similar to `getCollisionBoxes` but exclusively for blocks, avoiding the need for conditionally useless parameters
- The following API methods have been deprecated:
  - `World->getCollisionBoxes()` - use `getBlockCollisionBoxes()` instead (alongside `getCollidingEntities()` if entity collision boxes are also required)

### `pocketmine\utils`
- The following classes have been deprecated:
  - `EnumTrait` - use native PHP 8.1 enums instead
- The following classes have been added:
  - `LegacyEnumShimTrait` - can be `use`d by native PHP 8.1 enums to provide the same API as `EnumTrait`

## Gameplay
### Blocks
- Implemented the following blocks:
  - Amethyst
  - Amethyst Cluster
  - Chiseled Bookshelf
  - Crimson Roots
  - Pitcher Crop
  - Pitcher Plant
  - Torchflower
  - Torchflower Crop
  - Warped Roots

### Items
- Implemented the following items:
  - Pitcher Pod
  - Torchflower Seeds

## Internals
- `Farmland` block now has an extra property (`waterPositionIndex`) stored in its blockstate ID to track the position of nearby water. This property is not saved to disk, and is only used for caching.
- The format of internal blockstate ID has been updated.
  - The lower `11` bits are now reserved for state data (previously `8` bits). This increase facilitates the new cache for `Farmland` blocks.
  - The state data bits are now XOR'd with the `xxh3` of the block's type ID, instead of being directly XOR'd with the type ID.
    - This XOR improves the distribution of the lower bits of the blockstate ID, which is important for hashtable indexing to minimize collisions.
    - Previously, the lower bits were XOR'd with the type ID directly, but the effectiveness of this reduced as more state data bits were added.
    - `xxh3` produces consistently good results for this purpose regardless of the number of state data bits allocated.
    - Hash collisions with blockstate IDs are reduced by 50% with this change, which is a happy side effect.
  - This is backwards-incompatible, so anyone saving internal blockstate IDs on disk or in a DB will be burned by this change (though they shouldn't have been doing that anyway).
- Removed code generation step for `RuntimeDataDescriber` enum serialization. All described enums now use PHP 8.1 native enums, which can be described without codegen using `RuntimeDataDescriber->enum()`.
- Added `DeprecatedLegacyEnumAccessRule` custom PHPStan rule to flag legacy `EnumTrait` case accessors.
- Cleaned up remaining hardcoded `Config` keys in `SetupWizard`. These usages now use auto-generated constants like the rest of the codebase.

# 5.8.2
Released 9th November 2023.

## Performance
- Improved performance of small packet zero-compression (unintended use of slow zlib compressor instead of fast libdeflate one).
  - This affected the majority of outbound packets, as most packets are below the 256-byte threshold for compression.
  - This faster method is over 20x faster than the old method, producing noticeable performance gains for large servers.

## Fixes
- Fixed melons and pumpkins not growing.
- Fixed melon and pumpkin stems not attaching to the grown melon/pumpkin.
- Fixed iron and gold ores not being affected by the Fortune enchantment.
- Fixed ancient debris burning in lava.
- Fixed sign (front) text loading from vanilla world saves (back text is not yet supported).

## Internals
- Removed bogus optimization from `tools/generate-blockstate-upgrade-schema.php` that could cause incorrect `remappedStates` generation when some of the states stayed under the old ID.
- Fixed possible crash in `BlockStateUpgrader` name flattening rule handling with invalid blockstate NBT data.

# 5.9.0
Released 6th December 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.50**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.50.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.50.
- Removed support for older versions.

## Fixes
- Fixed `pitcher_plant` and `pitcher_pod` not being accepted by `StringToItemParser` (and therefore not being usable in commands).
- Rotation of items in item frames in worlds from newer versions of Bedrock is now correctly loaded.
- Fixed possible crash in block update sending if a chunk was unloaded during a previous chunk's block update syncing.
- Fixed `AsyncTask::fetchLocal()` throwing an exception if `null` was stored in the local storage.

## Documentation
- `Server::prepareBatch()` is now correctly marked as `@internal`.
- Updated documentation for `Server::prepareBatch()` to accurately reflect its behaviour.
- Fixed incorrect path in doc comments of `EnumTrait` and `RegistryTrait`.

## Internals
- Added PHP 8.3 to the test matrix. This has not been thoroughly tested yet, so it should only be used for testing purposes.

# 5.10.0
Released 14th December 2023.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.50**

This is a minor feature release, including new gameplay features and minor performance improvements.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- PHP 8.2 is now used by default. PHP 8.1 is still supported, but will be removed in a future 5.x release.
- Improved timings reports by removing `Breakdown` timings group. This group serves no purpose with tree timings and made for confusing reading.

## Performance
- Improved performance of `Block::encodeFullState()` in most conditions. This in turn improves performance of `World::setBlock()` and `World::setBlockAt()`.
- Improved network compression performance by avoiding unnecessary object allocations.
- Timings now report time spent in individual `Snooze` handlers, making it easier to debug performance issues.

## Gameplay
### Blocks
- Implemented crop growth speed modifiers.
  - The following things now positively affect crop growth speed:
    - Being planted on or being adjacent to farmland (hydrated farmland offers a larger benefit than dry farmland)
    - Potential light level of at least 9
    - Being planted in rows with space between them (or a different type of crop)
  - The following things now negatively affect crop growth speed:
    - Improper arrangement (e.g. the same crop on all sides)
    - Insufficient light level (below 9)
  - Poorly arranged crops will grow slower in this version. Past versions behaved as if crops were always planted in ideal conditions.
  - Crops planted in ideal conditions will grow at the same speed as before.

### Items
- Added the following new items:
  - All types of Smithing Template
- Pitcher Pod is now correctly registered. In previous versions, it was mapped to the Pitcher Crop block, causing incorrect name display in commands.

## Internals
- Cleaned up various getter usages where direct property access is possible.
- Avoided unnecessary repeated getter calls in some loops.
- `NetworkSession` may now track `string` instead of `CompressBatchPromise` when a batch was synchronously compressed. This significantly reduces object allocations and improves performance.
- `NetworkSession` now sends less information to clients on login validation failure. This avoids leaking potentially sensitive error information to clients.
  - Clients can correlate their disconnects with server-side logs using the `Error ID` shown on the disconnect screen.

# 5.11.0
Released 7th February 2024.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.60**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.60.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.60.
- Removed support for earlier versions.

## Fixes
- Fixed `tools/generate-item-upgrade-schema.php` not correctly handling items whose IDs were changed multiple times.
- Fixed `ServerKiller` not working correctly in some cases (incorrectly handled wake-up conditions).
- `ItemBlock`s of `Air` blocks are now always considered as "null" items regardless of count, and don't occupy inventory slots.

## Internals
- Restructured GitHub Actions CI workflows to make them easier to maintain (no need to update PHP versions in multiple places anymore).
- GitHub Actions CodeStyle workflow now uses php-cs-fixer 3.49.x.
- Dependabot updates are now processed weekly instead of daily.

# 5.11.1
Released 23rd February 2024.

## Fixes
- Fixed subchunk count calculation in `ChunkSerializer` for non-overworld dimension (useful for dimension plugins).
- Harden options used for processing JSON data, particularly on the network, to close security issues.

## Documentation
- Fixed PHPStan signature for `Utils::cloneObjectArray()`.

## Internals
- Updated GitHub Actions versions to get rid of deprecation warnings.

# 5.11.2
Released 26th February 2024.

## Fixes
- Added extra checks for `BookEditPacket` handling.

# 5.12.0
Released 28th February 2024

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.60**

This is a minor feature release, with a few new features and improvements.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added a `--version` command-line option to display the server version and exit.

## Tools
- Added `tools/generate-biome-ids.php` to generate `pocketmine\data\bedrock\BiomeIds`.
- Fixed ordering of property values generated by `tools/generate-block-palette-spec.php`.

## API
### `pocketmine\block`
- The following new classes have been added:
  - `utils\LightableTrait` - used by blocks with `getLit()` and `setLit()` methods
- The following methods have been deprecated:
  - `Block->isSolid()` - this method returns confusing results which don't match expectations and no one really knows what it actually means
- `CocoaBlock` now extends `Flowable` to match vanilla Minecraft behaviour.

### `pocketmine\plugin`
- `PluginManager->registerEvent()` now throws an exception when given a generator function for the event handler.
- `PluginManager->registerEvents()` now throws an exception if any of the detected event handlers are generator functions. Use `@notHandler` to have the function ignored if intended.

### `pocketmine\promise`
- The following methods have been added:
  - `public static Promise::all(list<Promise> $promises) : Promise` - returns a promise that is resolved once all given promises are resolved, or is rejected if any of the promises are rejected.

### `pocketmine\scheduler`
- The following methods have been deprecated:
  - `AsyncWorker->getFromThreadStore()` - use class static properties for thread-local storage
  - `AsyncWorker->removeFromThreadStore()`
  - `AsyncWorker->saveToThreadStore()`

## Documentation
- Improved documentation of various methods in `Block`.

## Gameplay
- The following new items have been added:
  - Name Tag

## Internals
- Removed specialization of shutdown logic for `Thread` vs `Worker` (no specialization is required).
- Authentication system no longer accepts logins signed with the old Mojang root public key.
- ID to enum mappings in `pocketmine\data` now use a new `match` convention to allow static analysis to ensure that all enum cases are handled.
- Updated version of `pocketmine/bedrock-protocol` allows avoiding decoding of some itemstack data from the client in most cases, improving performance.

# 5.12.1
Released 13th March 2024.

## Fixes
- Fixed `Player Network Receive - Decompression` timings not being stopped correctly when receiving an uncompressed packet.

## Internals
- Removed hardcoded batch packet size limit. This was already covered by other limits anyway.

# 5.13.0
Released 13th March 2024.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.70**

This is a support release for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.70.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.70.
- Removed support for earlier versions.

# 5.14.0
Released 5th April 2024.

**For Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.20.70**

This is a minor feature release, including performance improvements, minor gameplay features, new API features, and various internal improvements.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe`  or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- Added support for a `--no-log-file` command-line option, which disables the creation of a `server.log` file.
  - **Use this with caution.** If you don't have another mechanism for collecting logs (e.g. Docker), this may make debugging harder.
- Added support for automatic `server.log` rotation. When the `server.log` exceeds 32 MB, it will be renamed and moved to the `log_archive` folder in the server's data directory.
  - Files in the `log_archive` folder can be safely modified or deleted without stopping the server.
  - We suggest a cron job or similar to manage old log files (e.g. deleting or compressing them).
- Added a new cache mechanism for `PocketMine-MP.phar`. This has several advantages:
  - Caches are now reused by all threads - this significantly reduces `/tmp` usage (previously every thread generated its own cache, wasting lots of space)
  - Dead cache files are automatically cleaned up by new servers - this means that a server crash loop won't flood `/tmp` anymore
- `/status` now reports a more accurate number of threads on Windows.
- Large resource packs are now able to be properly downloaded from the server.
- Larger player skin sizes are now accepted by the server.
- Improved logging from world providers to reduce spam when chunks contain invalid data.
- Added more error logging for Anvil, PMAnvil and MCRegion worlds.
- PHP deprecation warnings no longer cause the server to crash. This should make it easier for server owners to update to newer PHP versions.

## Performance
- Improved world loading performance. This was achieved through a combination of changes:
  - Improvements to `BlockStateUpgrader` to avoid unnecessary work
  - Improvements to `BlockStateUpgradeSchema` to clean up stupid code
  - Improvements to `BlockStateReader` unused state handling
  - Optimizations to `RegistryTrait` (see below)
- Improved performance of `RegistryTrait::__callStatic()` accessor by introducing a fast-path optimization. Ensure that you access registries with the correct function name case to benefit from this.
  - This improves the performance of `VanillaBlocks::WHATEVER()`, `VanillaItems`, etc.

## Tools
- `tools/generate-blockstate-upgrade-schema.php` now supports generating schemas using `flattenedValueRemaps` (described in [BlockStateUpgradeSchema](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockBlockUpgradeSchema/releases/tag/4.0.0)).

## Gameplay
- Added sounds for armour equipping and unequipping.
- Added sound for picking berries from a sweet berry bush.

## API
### `pocketmine\block\utils`
- The following enum cases have been added:
  - `BannerPatternType::GLOBE`
  - `BannerPatternType::PIGLIN`

### `pocketmine\event\player`
- The following classes have been added:
  - `PlayerResourcePackOfferEvent` - called before the server tells a connecting client which resource packs are available to download - allows customizing the pack list and other options

### `pocketmine\item`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public ArmorMaterial->getEquipSound() : ?\pocketmine\world\Sound` - returns the sound to play when this armour is equipped or unequipped
- The following API methods have signature changes:
  - `ArmorMaterial->__construct()` now accepts an optional `?Sound $equipSound` parameter

### `pocketmine\utils`
- The following API methods have signature changes:
  - `MainLogger->__construct()` now accepts `null` for the `$logFile` parameter - this disables the creation of a logger thread and log file
  - `MainLogger->__construct()` now accepts an optional `?string $logArchiveDir` parameter. If set, this enables log archiving in the specified directory when the current log file exceeds 32 MB.

## Dependencies
- Now uses [`pocketmine/bedrock-block-upgrade-schema` version 4.0.0](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockBlockUpgradeSchema/releases/tag/4.0.0).
- Now uses [`pmmp/ext-pmmpthread` version 6.1.0](https://github.com/pmmp/ext-pmmpthread/releases/tag/6.1.0).
- Now uses [`pocketmine/errorhandler` version 0.7.0](https://github.com/pmmp/ErrorHandler/releases/tag/0.7.0).
- Now uses [`pocketmine/raklib` version 1.1.0](https://github.com/pmmp/RakLib/releases/tag/1.1.0).
- Now uses [`pocketmine/raklib-ipc` version 1.0.0](https://github.com/pmmp/RakLibIpc/releases/tag/1.0.0).

## Internals
- (Re)Added support for RakLib packet ACK receipts. This was used to throttle resource pack sending and prevent network overloading.
  - Added `NetworkSession->sendDataPacketWithReceipt()` to make use of this feature.
  - `PacketSender` now requires an additional `?int $receiptId` parameter.
- `ResourcePackPacketHandler` now uses `sendDataPacketWithReceipt()` to send resource packs, and delays sending the next chunk until the current one is acknowledged.
- `ResourcePackPacketHandler` now accepts resource pack info directly in the constructor, instead of `ResourcePackManager`. This eases the implementation of `PlayerResourcePackOfferEvent`.
- Increased `ZlibCompressor::DEFAULT_MAX_DECOMPRESSION_SIZE` to 8 MB (previously 2 MB). While this weakens server security, it appears to be necessary to deal with extremely bloated Persona skins.
- Increased max split packet parts accepted by `RakLib` to 512 (previously 128). Again, this is necessary to deal with extremely bloated Persona skins.
- Added a new cache mechanism for `PocketMine-MP.phar`.
  - `ext-phar`'s default mechanism is extremely wasteful (generating a separate cache file per thread), and doesn't clean up after itself.
  - The new cache mechanism is shared between all threads, and automatically cleans up stale caches.
  - The phar stub (`build/server-phar-stub.php`) now converts the phar contents into a `.tar`, and decompresses all the files into `$TMPDIR/PocketMine-MP-phar-cache.<random>/`.
  - `phar://` URIs still work with this system, but `new Phar(__FILE__)` must be replaced by `new PharData(__FILE__)` within PocketMine-MP core code.
  - Backtraces from a `phar`'d server will now point to a location in the extracted phar cache, rather than the phar itself.
- `block_factory_consistency_check` test (actually for `RuntimeBlockStateRegistry`) now stores less data, and is no longer affected by changes to internal state ID construction.

# 5.14.1
Released 5th April 2024.

- Removed support for earlier versions.

# 5.23.0
Released 5th December 2024.

This is a minor feature release, including new gameplay features, internals improvements, API additions and
deprecations, and improvements to timings.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## General
- `/timings` now supports collecting timings from async task workers. These new timings will be shown alongside `Full Server Tick` timings, but will not be counted in total load.
- Added `/xp` command.
- `start.sh` will now emit warnings when the server process exits with an unusual exit code. This helps to detect unexpected segmentation faults and other kinds of native errors.

## Gameplay
- Added the following new items:
  - End Crystal
  - Goat Horn (all variants)
  - Ice Bomb (from Education Edition)
  - Recovery Compass
- Added the following enchantments:
  - Frost Walker
- Sugarcane now self-destructs when there is no water adjacent to the base block.
- Added basic support for middle-clicking on entities to get their spawn eggs.
- Added sounds when drinking potions.
- Eating food is now allowed in creative mode and in peaceful difficulty.

## API
### `pocketmine\block`
- Extracted `MultiAnyFacingTrait` and `MultiAnySupportTrait` from `GlowLichen` to enable reuse in other blocks.
- The following API methods have been deprecated:
  - `Campfire->getInventory()` - this was added by mistake and can't be well-supported given the way that blocks work

### `pocketmine\command`
- The following classes have been added:
  - `ClosureCommand` - allows registering a closure to execute a command

### `pocketmine\event`
- Added APIs to `PlayerInteractEvent` to allow toggling item and block interactions.
  - This allows various customisations, such as allowing interactions when sneaking, selectively disabling item or block reactions, etc.
  - If both item and block interactions are disabled, the event is **not** cancelled (blocks can still be placed).
  - The following API methods have been added:
    - `public PlayerInteractEvent->setUseBlock(bool $useBlock) : void`
    - `public PlayerInteractEvent->setUseItem(bool $useItem) : void`
    - `public PlayerInteractEvent->useBlock() : bool` - returns whether the block can respond to the interaction (toggling levers, opening/closing doors, etc).
    - `public PlayerInteractEvent->useItem() : bool` - returns whether the item can respond to the interaction (spawn eggs, flint & steel, etc).
- The following new classes have been added:
  - `player\PlayerEntityPickEvent` - called when a player middle-clicks on an entity

### `pocketmine\inventory\transaction`
- The following API methods have been deprecated:
  - `InventoryAction->onAddToTransaction()`

### `pocketmine\permission`
- The following API methods have been deprecated:
  - `PermissionManager->getPermissionSubscriptions()`
  - `PermissionManager->subscribeToPermission()`
  - `PermissionManager->unsubscribeFromAllPermissions()`
  - `PermissionManager->unsubscribeFromPermission()`

### `pocketmine\plugin`
- The following classes have been deprecated:
  - `DiskResourceProvider`
  - `ResourceProvider`

### `pocketmine\promise`
- `Promise::all()` now accepts zero promises. This will return an already-resolved promise with an empty array.

### `pocketmine\scheduler`
- Added PHPStan generic types to `TaskHandler` and related APIs in `TaskScheduler` and `Task`.
- The following API methods have been deprecated
  - `AsyncTask->publishProgress()`
  - `AsyncTask->onProgressUpdate()`

### `pocketmine\timings`
- Timings can now notify other code when timings are enabled/disabled, reloaded, or collected.
  - The intent of this is to facilitate timings usage on other threads, and have the results collected into a single timings report.
  - Timings cannot directly control timings on other threads, so these callbacks allow plugins to use custom mechanisms to toggle, reset and collect timings.
  - PocketMine-MP currently uses this to collect timings from async task workers. More internal threads may be supported in the future.
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public static TimingsHandler::getCollectCallbacks() : ObjectSet<\Closure() : list<Promise<list<string>>>` - callbacks for (asynchronously) collecting timings (typically from other threads). The returned promises should be resolved with the result of `TimingsHandler::printCurrentThreadRecords()`.
  - `public static TimingsHandler::getReloadCallbacks() : ObjectSet<\Closure() : void>` - callbacks called when timings are reset
  - `public static TimingsHandler::getToggleCallbacks() : ObjectSet<\Closure(bool $enable) : void>` - callbacks called when timings are enabled/disabled
  - `public static TimingsHandler::requestPrintTimings() : Promise<list<string>>` - asynchronously collects timing results from all threads and assembles them into a single report
- The following API methods have been deprecated:
  - `TimingsHandler::printTimings()` - this function cannot support async timings collection. Use `TimingsHandler::requestPrintTimings()` instead.
  - `Timings::getAsyncTaskErrorTimings()` - internal method that is no longer needed
- The following constants have been deprecated:
  - `Timings::GROUP_BREAKDOWN` - no longer used

### `pocketmine\utils`
- The following API methods have been added:
  - `public static Utils::getRandomFloat() : float` - returns a random float between 0 and 1. Drop-in replacement for `lcg_value()` in PHP 8.4.

## Internals
- Blocks are now always synced with the client during a right-click-block interaction. This clears mispredictions on the client in case the new `PlayerInteractEvent` flags were customized by plugins.
- `VanillaBlocks` and `VanillaItems` now use reflection to lookup TypeId constants by registration name, instead of requiring TypeIds to be manually specified.
  - While this is obviously a hack, it prevents incorrect constants from being used when adding new blocks, and guarantees that the names of constants in `BlockTypeIds` and `ItemTypeIds` will match their corresponding entries in `VanillaBlocks` and `VanillaItems` respectively.
  - It also significantly improves readability of `VanillaBlocks` and `VanillaItems`, as well as eliminating ugly code like `WoodLikeBlockIdHelper`.
  - In PM6, the team is exploring options to redesign `VanillaBlocks` and `VanillaItems` to eliminate the need for defining separate TypeIds entirely.
- `ConsoleReader` now uses socket support in `proc_open()` to transmit IPC messages to the server process. Previously, a temporary socket server was used, which was unreliable in some conditions.
- Event handler tests have been converted to PHPUnit tests by mocking `Server` and `Plugin` instances. Previously, these required integration tests for these dependencies.
- Fixed various deprecation warnings in PHP 8.4.
- `netresearch/jsonmapper` is now used at `5.0.0`. The PMMP fork of this library has been removed, as it is no longer needed.

# 5.23.1
Released 5th December 2024.

## Fixes
- Fixed signs not creating a tile when placed.

## Internals
- Improved blockstate consistency check to detect tiles disappearing during refactors.

# 5.23.2
Released 9th December 2024.

## General
- Updated translations for Russian and Korean.

## Fixes
- Fixed server build number.
- Fixed some crashes being misreported as plugin-involved.

## Internals

# 5.23.3
Released 22nd January 2025.

## Fixes
- Fixed crashes with PHP internal stack frames being flagged as plugin crashes.
- Fixed note block instrument sounds in 1.21.50.

## Internals
- Updated GitHub issue templates to use issue forms.

# 5.24.0
Released 22nd January 2025.

This is a minor feature release, including new gameplay features, performance improvements, and minor API additions.

**Plugin compatibility:** Plugins for previous 5.x versions will run unchanged on this release, unless they use internal APIs, reflection, or packages like the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` or `pocketmine\data` namespace.
Do not update plugin minimum API versions unless you need new features added in this release.

**WARNING: If your plugin uses the `pocketmine\network\mcpe` namespace, you're not shielded by API change constraints.**
Consider using the `mcpe-protocol` directive in `plugin.yml` as a constraint if you're using packets directly.

## Performance
- PHP garbage collection is now managed by the server, instead of being automatically triggered by PHP.
  - The mechanism for GC triggering is designed to mimic PHP's to avoid behavioural changes. Only the place it's triggered from should be significantly different.
  - This change also avoids unnecessary GCs during object-heavy operations, such as encoding `CraftingDataPacket`. As such, performance during server join should see an improvement.
  - Timings is now able to directly measure the impact of GC. Previously, GC would show up as random spikes under random timers, skewing timing results.
- `ChunkCache` now uses `string` for completed caches directly instead of keeping them wrapped in `CompressBatchPromise`s. This reduces memory usage, improves performance, and reduces GC workload.

## Configuration
- The following settings have been removed from `pocketmine.yml` and will no longer have any effect:
  - `memory.garbage-collection.collect-async-worker` (now always `true`)
  - `memory.garbage-collection.low-memory-trigger` (now always `true`)
  - `memory.max-chunks.trigger-chunk-collect` (now always `true`)
  - `memory.world-caches.disable-chunk-cache` (now always `true`)
  - `memory.world-caches.low-memory-trigger` (now always `true`)

## Gameplay
- Added the following new blocks:
  - All types of pale oak wood, and leaves
  - Resin
  - Resin Bricks, Slabs, Stairs, and Walls
  - Resin Clump
  - Chiseled Resin Bricks
- Some blocks have had their tool tier requirements adjusted to match latest Bedrock updates.
- Added the following new items:
  - Resin Brick
  - Music Disc - Creator
  - Music Disc - Creator (Music Box)
  - Music Disc - Precipice
  - Music Disc - Relic

## API
### General
- Many places had their PHPDoc improved to address issues highlighted by PHPStan 2.x. This may cause new, previously unreported issues to be reported in plugins using PHPStan.

### `pocketmine`
- The following methods have been deprecated:
  - `MemoryManager->canUseChunkCache()`
  - `MemoryManager::dumpMemory()` - relocated to `MemoryDump` class

### `pocketmine\item`
- The following new enum cases have been added:
  - `RecordType::DISK_CREATOR`
  - `RecordType::DISK_CREATOR_MUSIC_BOX`
  - `RecordType::DISK_PRECIPICE`
  - `RecordType::DISK_RELIC`

### `pocketmine\player`
- The following new methods have been added:
  - `public Player->getFlightSpeedMultiplier() : float` - a base multiplier for player's flight speed
  - `public Player->setFlightSpeedMultiplier(float $flightSpeedMultiplier) : void` - sets the player's flight speed multiplier
- The following new constants have been added:
  - `Player::DEFAULT_FLIGHT_SPEED_MULTIPLIER`

### `pocketmine\utils`
- The following new methods have been added:
  - `public static TextFormat::javaToBedrock(string $string) : string` - removes unsupported Java Edition format codes to prevent them being incorrectly displayed on Bedrock
- The following methods have behavioural changes:
  - `TextFormat::toHTML()` now converts `§m` to redstone red (instead of strikethrough), and `§n` to copper orange (instead of underline). This is because the codes previously used for `STRIKETHROUGH` and `UNDERLINE` conflict with the new material codes introduced by Minecraft Bedrock.
  - `Terminal::toANSI()` now converts `§m` to redstone red (instead of strikethrough), and `§n` to copper orange (instead of underline), as above. However, underline and strikethrough can still be used on the terminal using `Terminal::$FORMAT_UNDERLINE` and `Terminal::$FORMAT_STRIKETHROUGH` respectively.
- The following new constants have been added:
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_QUARTZ`
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_IRON`
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_NETHERITE`
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_REDSTONE`
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_COPPER`
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_GOLD`
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_EMERALD`
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_DIAMOND`
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_LAPIS`
  - `TextFormat::MATERIAL_AMETHYST`
- The following constants have been deprecated:
  - `TextFormat::STRIKETHROUGH`
  - `TextFormat::UNDERLINE`
- The following static properties have been added:
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_QUARTZ`
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_IRON`
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_NETHERITE`
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_REDSTONE`
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_COPPER`
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_GOLD`
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_EMERALD`
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_DIAMOND`
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_LAPIS`
  - `Terminal::$COLOR_MATERIAL_AMETHYST`

## Tools
- Fixed some UI issues in `tools/convert-world.php`

## Internals
- Block cache in `World` is now size-limited. This prevents memory exhaustion when plugins call `getBlock()` many thousands of times with cache misses.
- `RakLibServer` now disables PHP GC. As RakLib doesn't generate any unmanaged cycles, GC is just a waste of CPU time in this context.
- `MemoryManager` now has the responsibility for triggering cycle GC. It's checked every tick, but GC won't take place unless the GC threshold is exceeded, similar to PHP.
  - This mechanism could probably do with alterations to better suit PocketMine-MP, but it was chosen to mimic PHP's own GC to minimize behavioural changes for now.
- `AsyncTask` now triggers cycle GC after `onRun()` completes. As with `MemoryManager`, this is based on a threshold designed to mimic PHP's own behaviour.
- `FormatConverter` now performs world provider GC periodically. This is not needed with current active providers, but was found to be a problem while developing custom providers.
- Various internal adjustments were made to avoid returning incorrectly-keyed arrays in the code. These changes shouldn't affect anything as the arrays should have been properly ordered anyway.
- Many places that previously used `==` and `!=` have been updated to use strict variants. This kind of change needs to be done carefully to avoid breaking `int|float` comparisons.

# 5.25.0

It also allows creating new collapsible groups of items, and modifying or removing existing ones.

- The following new methods have been added:
  - `public CreativeInventory->getAllEntries() : list<CreativeInventoryEntry>` - returns an array of objects, each containing a creative item and information about its category and collapsible group (if applicable).
  - `public CreativeInventory->getEntry(int $index) : ?CreativeInventoryEntry` - returns the creative item with the specified identifier, or `null` if not found
- The following methods have signature changes:
  - `CreativeInventory->add()` now accepts two additional optional parameters: `CreativeCategory $category, ?CreativeGroup $group`. If not specified, the item will be added to the Items tab without a group.
- The following new classes have been added:
  - `CreativeCategory` - enum of possible creative inventory categories (each has its own tab on the GUI)
  - `CreativeGroup` - contains information about a collapsible group of creative items, including tooltip text and icon
  - `CreativeInventoryEntry` - contains information about a creative inventory item, including its category and collapsible group (if applicable)

## Internals
- `CreativeContentPacket` is no longer fully cached due to the requirement for translation context during construction. The individual items are still cached (which is the most expensive part), but the packet itself is now constructed on demand, and group entries are constructed on the fly. This may affect performance, but this has not been investigated.
- `BedrockDataFiles` now includes constants for folders at the top level of `BedrockData` as well as files.
- The structure of creative data in `BedrockData` was changed to accommodate item category and grouping information. `creativeitems.json` has been replaced by `creative/*.json`, which contain information about item grouping and also segregates item lists per category.
- New information was added to `required_item_list.json` in `BedrockData`, as the server is now required to send item component NBT data in some cases.

# 5.25.1
Released 26th February 2025.

## Fixes
- Fixed confusing exception message when a block-breaking tool has an efficiency value of zero.
- Fixed incorrect facing of doors since 1.21.60 (resulted in mismatched AABBs between client & server, rendering glitches etc.)
- Resource pack UUIDs are now validated on load. Previously, invalid UUIDs would be accepted, and potentially cause a server crash on player join.
